  "body": "<p>We are delighted to be able to introduce to you the <a href=\"http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/intransition/theme-week/2014/10/intransition-videographic-film-moving-image-studies\">first issue</a> of the new journal <strong>[in]Transition</strong>. A collaboration between <span word=\"MediaCommons\" data-scaytid=\"2\">MediaCommons</span> and the Society for Cinema and Media Studies’ official publication, <em>Cinema Journal</em>, <strong>[in]Transition</strong> is the first peer-reviewed academic periodical specifically given over to <span word=\"videographic\" data-scaytid=\"5\">videographic</span> film and moving image studies.</p>\n<p>Practitioners of these forms (which include, <i>inter alia</i>, the ‘video essay’, ‘audiovisual essay’, and ‘visual essay’ formats) explore the ways in which digital technologies afford a new mode of carrying out and presenting their research. The full range of digital technologies now enables film and media scholars to write using the very materials that constitute their objects of study: moving images and sounds.</p>\n<p>Though a number of outstanding websites already present <span word=\"videographic\" data-scaytid=\"7\">videographic</span> work on occasion (indeed, we list some of them at our <a href=\"http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/intransition/resources/\" target=\"_blank\">Resources</a> page), none has yet received the disciplinary validation that is accorded to written scholarship. In large part, the strictures of written academic discourse pose a challenge for this nascent form of multi-media composition. <strong><strong>[in]Transition</strong> </strong>aims to address this issue. This journal is designed not only as a means to present selected <span word=\"videographic\" data-scaytid=\"13\">videographic</span> work, but to create a context for understanding it – and validating it – as a new mode of scholarly writing for the discipline of cinema and media studies and related fields. This goal will be achieved through editorial <span word=\"curating\" data-scaytid=\"19\">curating</span> of exemplary <span word=\"videographic\" data-scaytid=\"14\">videographic</span> works, through critical analysis and appreciation, pre-publication peer review and Open Peer Commentary.</p>\n<p>For the first four issues of <strong>[in]Transition</strong>, the co-editors and invited members of the editorial board will select existing <span word=\"videographic\" data-scaytid=\"20\">videographic</span> works to present as exemplary of the form. These issues will organize the chosen works thematically, around the various formal features that have already begun to take shape in <span word=\"videographic\" data-scaytid=\"21\">videographic</span> practice. Each video selection will normally be accompanied by a short critical essay that explains and justifies the work in two ways: for its creative use of multi-media tools; and for the way it creates a ‘knowledge effect’ – that is, for its impact as scholarship. The goal of these inaugural issues is to set the terms of evaluation for the future of the journal: to present selected work, and contextualize it for acceptance and validation by our discipline.</p>\n<p>In this, the <a href=\"http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/intransition/theme-week/2014/10/intransition-videographic-film-moving-image-studies\">first issue</a>, each <strong>[in]Transition</strong> co-editor has <span word=\"curated\" data-scaytid=\"24\">curated</span> his or her individual choice of a video or video series in order to reflect, across the issue as a whole, a range of different approaches to this evolving format. In part to illustrate the breadth of work beyond obviously discursive or meta-critical essay formats, and to show that such forms may not only be promising as communicative tools but also as ones central to fundamentally changed procedures of audiovisual research<i> by digital practice</i>, we are also delighted to be able to present, for the first time in an integral version online (a remix remixed in 2013), Laura <span word=\"Mulvey’s\" data-scaytid=\"49\">Mulvey’s</span> visual analysis of a fragment of <i>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</i> (Howard Hawks 1953), in particular of the song and dance duet, “Two Little Girls from Little Rock”, performed by Jane Russell and Marilyn Monroe.</p>\n<p>In her 2006 book <i>Death Twenty-four Times a Second</i>, a foundational text for digital film studies in so many ways, <span word=\"Mulvey\" data-scaytid=\"50\">Mulvey</span> mentions this remix briefly as an experiment in the kind of 'delayed cinema' that she was writing about. In her video, <span word=\"Mulvey\" data-scaytid=\"51\">Mulvey</span> re-edited a 30-second movement sequence, stretching it into three minutes, pausing on Monroe’s gestures and repeating the sequence, twice slowed down and silent, but beginning and ending with normal speed. In a forthcoming essay about her experiment, she writes</p>\n<p>Before I had ever thought of re-editing the sequence, I had watched it many times, fascinated by Marilyn’s ability to hover between movement and stillness and the way that the pauses, slow motion and repetitions of delayed cinema simply, in this case, materialised something that was already there. I realised that my attention had been literally caught as the figure moved into a fleeting moment of stasis; and that I paused the film to catch the high point within this unfolding of a gesture. It seemed that digitally derived ‘delayed cinema’ had a special, privileged relationship to cinematic gesture. In the end, I decided to turn these moments of casual analysis (always partly trying to possess and hold on to the body, partly reflecting on and analysing its cinematic nature) into a re-mix. [Mulvey 2014]</p>\n<p>By showcasing Laura <span word=\"Mulvey’s\" data-scaytid=\"27\">Mulvey’s</span> work in our very first entry at <strong>[in]Transition</strong>, we are thrilled to be able to pay tribute to her pioneering role in the emergent digital and <span word=\"videographic\" data-scaytid=\"25\">videographic</span> field of film and moving image studies, as well as in other earlier areas of our discipline, which she also enriched with her filmmaking practice. We are deeply honored that she has joined our editorial board, along with a number of other scholars whose own foundational contributions to film studies in the last decades also extend to <span word=\"videographic\" data-scaytid=\"26\">videographic</span> forms (Janet <span word=\"Bergstrom\" data-scaytid=\"30\">Bergstrom</span>, Pam Cook, Thomas <span word=\"Elsaesser\" data-scaytid=\"31\">Elsaesser</span>, Kristin Thompson and Yuri <span word=\"Tsivian\" data-scaytid=\"32\">Tsivian</span>), as well as some of the other first academic critics, theorists and historians to experiment successfully with these and related digital film studies forms on, as well as off, line (Eric <span word=\"Faden\" data-scaytid=\"33\">Faden</span>, Tag Gallagher and Adrian Martin), innovative and esteemed online film critics, filmmakers and digital essayists (Cristina <span word=\"Álvarez\" data-scaytid=\"34\">Álvarez</span> <span word=\"López\" data-scaytid=\"35\">López</span>, Nelson <span word=\"Carvajal\" data-scaytid=\"36\">Carvajal</span>, Mark Cousins, Kevin B.
