  "body": "<p>My piece <em>Itinéraire</em> <em>d’un</em> <em>ciné-fils</em> <em>de…</em> <em>#3:</em> <em>Le</em> <em>cercle</em> <em>rouge</em> <em>(1970)</em> was made using sounds from Jean-Pierre Melville’s <em>Le cercle rouge </em>(France, 1970) and the trailer for the film. In order to explain the piece’s aim, making and use of sound - while also responding to the reviewer’s comments - I wish to reflect on three aspects: first, my fascination with the sound of <em>Le cercle rouge</em>’s trailer versus the film’s; second, my inspiration from the radiophonic genre <em>ciné-mix</em>; third, the overall idea and underpinnings of the series which this piece is part of and which reflects in its title.</p>\n<p>Apart from being one of my favourite Melville films it has often occurred to me how different a rhythmic dynamic <em>Le cercle rouge</em>’s trailer suggests in comparison to the film itself. While the film builds its suspense with a slow jazzy and cool pace the trailer is, in some parts, loud and characterised by an interesting use of different playback speeds. In particular, the trailer’s beginning manipulates drumming and shooting sounds, contrasting their playback in slow motion and standard speed. Indeed, as the reviewer points out, this can be seen as a conventional form of repackaging. Yet, for me, these different sound expressions felt like an invitation to play with and appropriate samples from the film and its trailer. Intrigued by the trailer’s dramatic effect and tension, I wanted to take its use of sound further by manipulating the playback speed of sounds and dialogue from the film, as a way to reframe the feverish chase on the main character Corey (Alain Delon). By contrasting slowed down sounds and standard speed as in the trailer my aim was to make a work which highlights the underlying deceptive and ominous nature of the situations which Corey goes through and the promises being made to him. To achieve this, the piece plays with repetition of dialogue snippets and sounds at different speeds, mixed with sounds from different locations - the train, the woods, the police station, the pool hall and the nightclub - layered onto a loop of the trailer’s slow-motion drumming. With my selection and combination of dialogue samples, I have wished to offer the listener cues about the film’s overall plot lines in a somewhat elliptical manner, while conveying the plot’s unfolding. Some samples are arranged in chronological order, others are repeated so as to establish and play with recurrent motifs as a way to underline the turn of events and changing relations between characters.</p>\n<p>The piece is roughly divided into three parts. The piece’s introductory part, running from the beginning until approximately one minute and twenty seconds, contains snippets from the police directors’ discussion on the urgency of finding Vogel and stages Inspector Mattei as the main investigator. The section is framed by Corey’s remark about the dangers of entering the Red Circle, at the beginning and the end, to give a cue about the plans he is making and the dangers he is facing. The middle part - which runs approximately from one minute and twenty seconds to two minutes and fifty-six seconds - follows respectively Mattei’s, Vogel’s and Corey’s trajectories, focussing mostly on the latter. As Mattei tries to chase down Vogel in the jazz club and other places, Corey flees to Paris with Vogel, seeks out old acquaintances, settles scores and sets up a heist. The final part begins at three minutes and twelve seconds, marked by the overlapping voices of the police directors at different speeds. My intention with this variation on the introduction’s opening, was to (hopefully) give it a dreamlike, surreal feel, and to signal that Corey is about to be caught in Mattei’s web. To clarify the lexical meaning of the samples, I have created an outline containing time codes and translations of the dialogue samples, which are visible to the left beneath the embeded audio player. The outline is partly based on the subtitles for the film I had available and my own translation.</p>\n<p>My approach to sound in this piece is inspired by the <em>ciné-mix </em>genre and format. Roughly speaking, a <em>ciné-mix </em>is an essayistic approach to film sound which lends techniques and approaches from radio art and musique concrète to process soundtrack and music samples to ultimately create cinephile appropriation works. The works of the group RadioMentale (Jean-Yves Leloup and Eric Pajot) on <em>auteur </em>and trash cinema - such as <em>Una dolce notte </em>(2003) which explores the soundscapes of Fellini’s films,<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\" id=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a> or <em>Traumavision</em> (2004) released in the Stembogen label's <em>Movies in Your Head</em>-series – are particularly representative of the ciné-mix genre. The statement accompanying <em>Una dolce notte </em>nicely encapsulates the <em>ciné-mix</em>’s cinephile, idiosyncratic approach, and, I think, illustrates what I try to achieve in my own sound pieces:</p>\n<p>\"The idea is ultimately (...) to play on different levels of perception, between respectful evocation of the filmmaker’s <em>oeuvre</em>, documentary and critical intention, and personal interpretation...\"</p>\n<p>Thinking along these lines, I make ciné-mixes by writing down time codes of sounds which I find intriguing when watching – or sometimes just listening to – films. Subsequently, I use my sampler – an Akai MPC1000 - to sample and process the sounds and mix them together in loops, sequences   and tracks.</p>\n<p>The <em>ciné-mix </em>format has inspired me, but there are many other approaches which one could take to the appropriation of film sound, and I appreciate that the reviewer highlights additional examples beyond the case of RadioMentale. Bringing attention to a more diverse array of practices and formats, I believe, is important because it may offer inspiration and entice scholars to increasingly explore and analyze film from critical perspectives through sound - perhaps as part of existing scholarly film podcasts. I did not know about the specific examples mentioned by the reviewer, but have had the chance to listen to and enjoy them since receiving the feedback. An additional example of radiophonic work that I find inspirational is Elaine Tierney and Jack Rollo’s essayistic radio show <a href=\"https://www.nts.live/shows/timeisaway\"><em>Time Is Away</em></a> on NTS, which combines film sounds, soundtrack music, library recordings and experimental music (and everything in between) to profile the work of directors, genres and periods or engage with various themes and concepts.</p>\n<p>The piece’s title refers to the name of a series I have been making for myself that I call <em>Itinéraire d'un ciné-fils de... </em>As a modest homage to film critic Serge Daney - whose writings I admire - the series plays a tongue in cheek pun on the title of the interview with the late Daney - <em>Itinéraire d'un ciné-fils </em>(<em>Journey of a “Cine-Son”</em>, Pierre-André Boutang &amp; Dominique Rabourdin, France 1992) - in which he recounts his life as a cinephile, and shares his concerns and reflections on the increased pervasiveness of television and cinema's transition to the small screen. Taking the cue from Daney’s endeavour to critically interrogate this transition, my series reflects a personal itinerary of film watching which takes place across an increasingly variegated range of formats and locations - from film museum screenings and home video formats to informal online platforms. By adding a <em>de... </em>to <em>fils </em>I suggest a bastard origin (in English this could translate into <em>Journey of a “Cine-Son” of a...</em>) in order to emphasise the heterogeneous and inevitably hybrid material foundations of cinephile film viewing today, while embracing the forms of appropriation they allow for in my sound work. Thus, my ciné-mixes aspire to reflect a passage of a cinephile heritage between different carriers, while producing a personal, idiosyncratic audio trace of my viewing experiences.</p>\n<p>On a final note, I would like to thank the reviewer for the highly perceptive remarks he took the time to prepare. They have been very productive for my further thinking about my sampling work, pointing me to aspects of genre analysis and the making of trailers that I am still thinking through. In particular, I am intrigued by the reviewer’s suggestion that the trailer might be situated as an antecedent to today’s remix culture (but as the reviewer, I cannot come up with an immediate answer to that either).</p>\n<div>\n<div id=\"ftn1\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\" title=\"\" id=\"_ftn1\">[1]</a><em> Una dolce notte </em>was originally commissioned by the French Ministry of Culture, and can be found with its accompanying statement at: <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/radiomentale-1/radiomentale-una-dolce-notte\">https://soundcloud.com/radiomentale-1/radiomentale-una-dolce-notte</a>, last accessed October 12, 2017.

      "body": "<p><em>[in]Transition is pleased to present this special issue on audiographic criticism, guest edited by Neil Verma and Jacob Smith. This issue represents a distinct innovation for the journal, removing the moving images that have been at the core of videographic criticism. Jason Mittell shepherded the issue for the journal, and offers thanks to Neil, Jacob, and their contributors &amp; reviewers for their excellent work. </em></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"#bottom\">Scroll down</a> past the introduction to directly access the audiographic essays.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Critical Audiography: Lessons of a “Stereophonic” Approach</strong>   </p>\n<p>About twelve miles West of Charing Cross station, in the London borough of Hillingdon, lies the town of Hayes. If you were visiting there in the winter of 2018, you would have found a large construction site just steps from the light rail station, part of a £250 million redevelopment with high rises and midrise towers that will include 642 homes, a cinema and a performance venue. It’s called the Old Vinyl Factory, for good reason. In the 20<sup>th</sup> century the recording giant EMI had a factory here, where they pressed and packaged famous records by the Beatles and Pink Floyd. Today, developers are milking this heritage for all it’s worth. On the wall of a lounge on the first floor of one set of flats blazes an orange neon sign reading “Record Store,” although no dusty albums are for sale. Between buildings sit concrete benches shaped like record players, with stylized steel tonearms as elbow rests. A stretched-fabric mural covers a car park with images of screaming teenage Beatles fans, while iconic Brit rock lines are painted across low walls (“Put on your red shoes and dance the blues” “There’s nothing you can do that can’t be done”). And there in the center of it all is a two-story sculpture harkening back to an even earlier era, one that any sound studies scholar or music buff would know instantly: Nipper, the charming terrier from Francis Barraud’s 1899 <em>His Master’s Voice</em> logo used by Victor Records and the Gramophone Company Ltd in the U.K., an early global icon of music on disc.</p>\n<p>It is striking that, like many modern homages to the famous image, the sculpture bungles the whole idea. Because there is no Victrola horn into which Nipper’s quizzical gaze and billowing ears are directed – no source of the “master’s voice” in <em>His Master’s Voice</em> – the miracle promised by recording technology is lost. This is supposed to be a dog communing with its lost owner whose voice has been preserved on a cylinder or disc, a terrier testifying to the fidelity of mechanized sound by performing fidelity to his master. But the device emblematizing that preservation is nowhere to be seen (at least, nothing had been put in place as of 2018). In trying to honor the legacy of 20<sup>th</sup> century musical recording technology (or to squeeze out any nostalgia left for it), the sculpture only depicts its absence. At the Old Vinyl Factory lofts, faithful old Nipper is listening to something that isn’t there.  </p>\n<p>Thinking about sonic absences – specifically about listening for forms that should be there but aren’t  – captures something we experienced as we developed this special double issue of <em>[in]Transition </em>focusing on academic thought that takes the form of digital sound. In 2017 the editors of this publication generously offered us the incredible opportunity to use this unique platform to bring focus to emerging digital practices that are a sonic corollary of videography, and that we are calling “audiography”: a form that leverages digital technology to use the very materials of audio media in order to present research <em>about</em> audio media. The desire to explore the audiographic as an expressive mode seemed inevitable, in part thanks to the rise of podcasts in academic settings, both in and out of the classroom, where many professors and creators are no longer satisfied with using digital recording for mere lecture capture, and instead wish to incorporate its emerging social forms and technological affordances into the shape of their argumentation. Indeed, audiography has already taken hold, with podcasts like SCMS’s <a href=\"http://www.aca-media.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Aca-Media</em></a>, Stanford’s <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/state-of-the-human/id518898586\" target=\"_blank\"><em>State of the Human</em></a>, Mack Hagood’s <a href=\"http://phantompod.org/about-us-2/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Phantom Power</em></a> and Lance Dann and Martin Spinelli’s <a href=\"https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/for-your-ears-only-martin-spinelli-and-A2ilweVf0yj/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>For Your Ears Only</em></a>, as well as shows from the nonacademic world that explore a range of sound phenomena, such as <a href=\"https://www.20k.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Twenty Thousand Hertz</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.radiodramarevival.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Radio Drama Revival</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.youmustrememberthispodcast.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>You Must Remember This</em></a> and <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/masterclass_podcast\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Masterclass</em></a>. If podcasts such as those represent “audio” art moving into the space of “graphic” textuality, online textual forms are increasingly importing linked or even embedded audio to help make arguments. Examples include <a href=\"https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/558606/558607\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Journal of Sonic Studies</em></a>, <a href=\"https://ro.uow.edu.au/rdr/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>RadioDoc Review</em></a>, and especially <a href=\"https://soundstudiesblog.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Sounding Out!</em></a><em>,</em> which for a decade has been a pioneer of “doing” sound studies through the integration of sonic elements that help explore the relationship between sound and social difference.  </p>\n<p>There are antecedents to this kind of work. One need only look to the practices of acoustic ecologists, field recordists, sound artists and deep listening practitioners (we are thinking here of Annea Lockwood, Hildegard Westerkamp, Mendi + Keith Obadike or Pauline Oliveros), and radio feature-making and sound documentary (the work of Alan Hall, Joe Richman and Cathy FitzGerald, for instance) to see clear elements of a sharp critical sensibility embedded in formal practices oriented to audiences beyond the walls of the academy. A quirky antecedent from the domain of media studies can be found in Marshall McLuhan’s Columbia LP “The Medium is the Massage” (1968), which attempts to use sound effects, music, and multiple speakers to convey the texture of contemporary media culture. A more contemporary effort that resonates with many works in this issue is the <a href=\"https://citiesandmemory.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Cities and Memory</u></a> project, which since 2014 has mapped thousands of sounds from 80 countries around the world along with “reimaginings” of each recording, pieces that often land somewhere between art and theory. In our own program in Sound Arts and Industries at Northwestern we encourage students to communicate sound studies and sound science using sound media, and our regional organization the Great Lakes Association for Sound Studies (GLASS) includes critical soundwalks and experimental recording as part of its ambit. Jacob Smith’s recent project <em>ESC: Sonic Adventure in the Anthropocene</em> (University of Michigan Press, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.10120795\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.10120795</a>), uses audio as the medium for an eco-critical analysis of the CBS Radio adventure series <em>Escape</em> (1947–54), and demonstrates that a place exists for audiographic criticism in the domain of academic publication.</p>\n<p>Yet even in all these current examples and antecedents, there seemed no universal model of what audiographic work might sound like, no recipe or set of parameters about what to record, how to record it, how to mix it and present it, how to legitimize it and cite it, how to integrate sound tracks with text, the degree of scholarly apparatus to import – to name just a few thorny methodological, theoretical and technical problems the audiographer faces and that set her apart from other kinds of academic creators. Our thought was that an open call process might yield such a model, and that this platform could play a crucial role in enshrining it. After all, as its mission statement explains, <em>[in]Transition </em>is a platform not only to present work, but to give it disciplinary validation to “create a context for understanding” a form. Like Nipper in Barraud’s painting, we had the opportunity to listen to, and potentially legitimize an innovation, to “recognize” it on behalf of the disciplines of sound and media studies.</p>\n<p>In the end, however, it turned out we were more like the Nipper at the Old Vinyl Factory site than the Nipper on the classic logo, in that our attention focused less on a unified object, and more on a suggestive absence. Despite our intention to locate a singular blueprint for audiographic work, we found that no single submission we received felt like its shape and method could be exportable to the circumstances of one of the others, and that there was therefore no concrete formula before us. This was a blessing in disguise. In this issue, you will find a stunning variety of contexts, materials and engagements, testifying to the breadth and ambition of sound studies today. Our audiographers used sound as an entry way to fresh explorations of feminist <em>avant garde</em> artwork, themes of refugee experience and of nomadism, textures of vernacular experience ranging from teenage videos to spaces of elegiac memory, remediations from cinema to podcasting, issues of preservation, and sonic activism in the wake of recent travel bans. In contexts from Ohio to Vienna, from Syria to Bangalore, our authors cover topics including migrant experiences of “orientation,” ciné-mix cultural habits as an expression of a viewing itinerary, haptic aesthetics in women’s vocal performance, podcast archiving, and communion with postmemorial ghosts.</p>\n<p>While there may not have been a dominant defining mode to the contributions in this special issue, we heard some important themes emerging as it took shape. As Jonathan Sterne has observed, the capacious curiosity of sound students is often met by an equally energized self-awareness of their own positional partiality (Sterne 2012, 4). In this case, while our group of audiographers have wide-ranging interests and disciplinary affiliations, they share an awareness that their academic work is “positioned” by attending media forms. As our responses point out in the articles that follow, each author seems to have selected one or two sonorous forms as an “other” that their argumentative and expressive intervention emulates, draws upon or stands in tension with. Thus audiographies in this issue reflect and inflect sonic forms we already recognize, including academic talks, DVD commentaries, radio documentaries, audiobooks, radio interviews, sound installations, fandubs and more. If we are looking for a single, common form of the audiography itself, we may be out of luck on this outing. Other than taking the form of an audio track supported by a textual statement, these pieces have little in common thematically. But they do share a gesture: each one reaches from an established expressive audio form toward a mode of scholarly critical engagement, or reaches from an established mode of scholarly engagement toward an established expressive audio form. In this way, audiographers trace a line across a gulf, but they do so in a way that need not blaze a permanent path. In negotiating the space between scholarly practice and the audio arts, audiographers create overlaps that are curiously unexpected, impermanent, and ad hoc. For this reason, we view the submissions in this issue as lessons in how, within the context of a particular political or intellectual project, a creator can negotiate between what it takes to make sound work and what it takes to make sound think. </p>\n<p>Audiography as we understand it means using recording and mixing as <em>intellectual</em> tools, as essential components in the act of making an academic argument with the audio form in mind; as opposed to using sound as an afterthought. Audiography negotiates making sound work and making sound think, and so links an evolving scholarly discourse with an evolving genre of audio. To capture this interwoven “two-channel\" aspect of audiography we might consider another part of the history of the EMI factory in West London. A generation before The Beatles and a generation after the Nipper painting, the Hayes site was not just a working factory but also a laboratory, one of the key sites (along with Bell Labs) in which concepts and models for stereophonic sound were developed. Legendary engineer Alan Blumlein worked on this site when EMI was formed in 1931, the same year he filed his famous patent 394, 325, which defined some 70 separate processes, materials, and methods for how to record and transduce two-channel stereo recordings. In fact, the train you take to get to the Old Vinyl Factory lofts runs along the same line on which Blumlein and his team recorded one of the <a href=\"https://www.emiarchivetrust.org/trains-at-hayes-the-worlds-first-stereo-film-made-in-1935-clip/\" target=\"_blank\">earliest stereophonic films</a>.  Of course, experiments in binaural and stereophonic sound had been around for more than a century by then, deriving their logic from what Théberge, Divine and Everett call the historical rise of the spatialized acoustic subject (See Théberge, Divine and Everett 2015). In the 1930s, stereo was still ahead of its time as a commercial matter – most of Blumlein’s techniques were unused until after the patent expired in 1952 and stereo returned as a music technique in the late 1950s (Anderson 2006; Schmidt Horning 2015). Among Blumlein’s key insights in this lineage was to work out the mathematics that converts the <em>phase difference</em> of a sound that hits two recording sources at the same time into an <em>amplitude difference</em>, which gives many listeners the illusion of dimensionality (Burns 2000). This was one of several techniques EMI labs devised that allowed for creating a stereo spread that could be produced using only two loudspeakers, without resulting in the “hole in the middle” that had bedeviled previous systems.</p>\n<p>Much has been written about the way two-channel stereo rationalizes a certain relation to the world through the construction of “sweet spots” for listening along with new aesthetics for “realism” and gendered hierarchies of experience in it (see Grajeda 2015; Keightley 1996). The recording process that creates that effect remains grounded in concepts developed at Hayes and places like it in the mid 20<sup>th</sup> century, but today it can be achieved through a range of configurations: using two omnidirectional mics spaced from one another; two cardioid microphones placed at 90-degree angles one atop the another; dummy head configurations, that create a dead zone where the flesh and skull of a listener might be, producing “3-D” audio; and more recent ambisonic technologies designed to push beyond stereophonic applications and into VR (see Virostek 2013, 189-96). However they are configured, though, the idea of stereophonic representation is rooted in the material fact of two slightly different perceptions occurring at once, captured at a common rate, across a small but perceptually significant gulf of space or time. The stereo recordist’s art is to find a way to stitch those two nearly identical experiences together into a form that resolves them, an artificial and temporary unity of perception.</p>\n<p>This, we wish to submit, is an apt metaphor for the dilemma of the audiographer, and one that each creator in this issue resolves in their own way. On the one side, there is scholarship, and all the propositional and non-propositional ways that academics go about producing, processing, disrupting, circulating and storing knowledge. On the other side are a myriad of expressive sound forms – from audiobooks to seances, podcasts to field recordings – that give the audiographer a form to work in, and a potential listening public to reach. Audiography, for us, is what happens when these two resonating entities overlap and create a temporary illusion of a center derived from the margins. We said above that this special issue doesn’t have a hard and fast <em>model</em> for potential audiographers, but it does have a series of <em>lessons</em> in the way each creator uses her unique position between a discourse and an expressive form to create her own sweet spot based on material and method. In aggregate, these works also have a philosophy, one we might liken to post-Blumlein stereophonic practices: it is <em>by virtue of</em> an absent center to the genre – and not in spite of it – that critical audiographic logics may emerge.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Works Cited</strong></p>\n<p>Anderson, Tim. 2006. <em>Making Easy Listening: Material Culture and Postwar American Recording</em>.

      "body": "<p><em>Itinéraire d’un ciné-fils de... #3: Le cercle rouge (1970)</em> is an audiographic project that emerges from a genre of audio-based film criticism called “<em>ciné-mix</em>.” Olesen describes how this practice has ties to experimental radio and musique concrète (not to mention the <em>[in]Transition</em>-style video essay), but this is a form that also bears a family resemblance to fan practices: fan remixes, supercuts, etc. As such, the project might serve as a prompt to consider vernacular audio practices as sources of inspiration for audiography. Moreover, Olesen’s incorporation of the soundtrack to the film’s trailer is a surprisingly resonant move, one that perhaps gives new meaning to Michel Chion’s well-known claim that “there is no soundtrack.” Trailers, radio and television advertisements, soundtrack albums – all of these show that many commercial films have ceased to have a singular, stable soundtrack even before they arrive in movie theaters.</p>\n<p>The fact that Olesen stages this instability in an audio format rather than a “purely” visual one emphasizes the manipulation of playback rates inherent in the raw material; it also scumbles boundaries between text and paratext that may have been more apparent in an audiovisual iteration of this project. The effect is highly distinctive. As Olesen’s statement make clear, if manipulation is the work of the “itinerary,” idiosyncrasy is the road it travels. When he writes of a “passage between carriers” of cinephilia and its inevitable hybridity of material foundations, Olesen points us to the way that listening to this recording we feel we are encountering a personal viewing memory – always liable to mistake inside for outside, trailer from film – that is being transmogrified into a tape moving back and forth across the transport of a recorder.</p>\n"

      "body": "<p>Christian Gosvig Olesen’s submission to this issue of <em>[in]Transition </em>is a marvelous example of cinephilic audiography. It strikes me as a true hybrid form in that it works as a wholly self-contained piece of curated sound art, yet also poses critical questions about the relations between texts and paratexts. </p>\n<p>As Olesen notes in his supporting statement, he was inspired by the <em>ciné-mix</em> genre, specifically citing RadioMentale’s “Una dolce note” as a role model. Olesen, however, takes a somewhat unusual step in mixing the sounds of Jean Pierre Melville’s <em>Le circle rouge </em>with the sounds of its original trailer. The sampling of sounds from both sources highlights the transformative nature of the latter, namely the way it acts as a “come-on” for potential viewers, hyping the film’s action scenes in a manner that not only downplays Melville’s distinctive style, but also repackages the film as a more conventional <em>policier</em>. </p>\n<p><em>Itinéraire d’un ciné-fils</em> begins with a jazzy riff played by the vibes and piano that almost immediately evokes the world of French <em>films noir</em>. The looping of this riff, though, resituates it within another aesthetic context: the overlapping domains of sound art, electronic dance music, and <em>musique concrète</em>. The repetition of sampled dialogue adds another rhythmic overlay to the jazz riff, taking us even further afield from <em>Le circle rouge</em>’s rather cool, impassive tone. The addition of drum sounds about 30 seconds into the piece introduces a slightly off-kilter counterrhythm. The drum beats eventually steady, creating the kind of pace we associate with a “pulse-pounding” thriller. Yet the specific lines chosen by Olesen counter that impression: a loose collection of phrases and mottos that more closely mimics Melville’s laconic yet elliptical storytelling.</p>\n<p><em>Itinéraire d’un ciné-fils</em> beautifully captures that tension that is created in the contrasting rhythms of his sources. Yet it also initiates a critical dialogue about the broader histories of both the <em>ciné-mix </em>genre and the movie trailer itself. Popular music has a long history of appropriating samples of film music, dialogue, and sound effects. The Wu-Tang Clan famously incorporated sounds from Kung Fu classics, like <em>The Five Deadly Venoms</em> (1978). 1985’s <em>Big Audio Dynamite</em> sampled dialogue and music from <em>Performance, The Treasure of Sierra Madre</em>, and three Sergio Leone westerns. Even REO Speedwagon used a line from a Little Rascals short to introduce “Tough Guys” on <em>Hi Infidelity</em>. The <em>ciné-mix</em> genre may be distinct in limiting its materials to only film sounds. But the legacy of cinephilic quotation obviously has deep roots in popular music culture.</p>\n<p>Olesen’s submission also broaches larger issues regarding the types of mediation performed by trailers. Are they a predecessor of what we think of today as “remix culture?”  I don’t have an answer to that question, but <em>Itinéraire d’un ciné-fils</em> suggests it as a tantalizing possibility. By displaying important continuities between these practices, Olesen hints that a trailer is as much a “reading” of a film as any mashup, “scanlation,” fandub, or <em>ciné-mix</em> is.</p>\n<p><strong>Reviewer Bio</strong></p>\n<p>Jeff Smith is a Professor of Communication Arts at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  He is the author of <em>The Sounds of Commerce: Marketing Popular Film Music and Film Criticism</em>, and <em>The Cold War, and the Blacklist: Reading the Hollywood Reds</em>.</p>\n"
