  "body": "<p>I’ve made a few video essays about TV shows before, all for my YouTube Channel, “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCftKveYOybv-SXXKsYE0_SA\">Overthinking it</a>.” Given YouTube was where I first discovered video essays, the style of videos I made was similar to those you’ll often find on YouTube: all used extensive voiceover or to-camera explanation of pre-written points. In some ways, these videos were more typically “academic” in presentation, given the main argument came in the form of a written (or in this case performed) thesis.</p>\n<p>When I came to study my master’s in Digital Media, I found out more about videographic criticism in academic circles and began to watch more experimental video essays, without words or narration. In my own practice I began playing with the affordances/modalities of the moving image beyond narration (editing, sound, imagery, etc.) to both research and present (or perhaps perform) a critical stance of some kind.</p>\n<p>I was deeply moved by <em>I May Destroy You</em>, and fascinated with its nuanced, exploratory story structure that represented a full circle of dealing with or “handling” a traumatic incident. I knew I wanted to make something about this show, and the TV Dictionary acted as the perfect catalyst. My love for and connection to the show were also informed by my own identity and experiences as a woman.</p>\n<p>I chose the word “handle” to sum up the show because of the way the various definitions (“to manipulate physically,” “to confront,” “to overcome,” etc.) could be used to tell the story of this circle of trauma and healing that the show draws so well. The result, I hope, is a kind of mini-retelling of the show and my own interpretation of it.</p>\n<p>Making video essays, particularly when messing around with footage in editing software, feels like I’m breaking into the shows I love, which I find rewarding simultaneously as a fan, artist and critic. I dislike tendencies that assume the fan and the critic or academic are profoundly different. I agree with Mulvey that the affordances of digital editing software have inspired a “new wave of cinephelia,” and that “there is always a personal edge to the mix of intellectual curiosity and fetishistic fascination.” (Mulvey, 2006, pp. 144-145) I have found this blurring to be true of my own practice.</p>\n<p>I also enjoyed bringing music to the centre in the process of this project, and I used the song “It’s Gonna Rain” by Rev. Milton Brunson and The Thompson Community Singers, which was featured on the soundtrack of the show. As I made the video, I began editing clips in time with the song, which links to some of Grant’s work on the potential of film studies “in the groove,” where music allows you to “enter more fully (corporeally, <em>carnally</em>) into a rhythmic engagement with what [we] see and hear, in order to feel more <em>on track</em>, <em>in a groove</em>, as part of a greater sympathetic engagement with the visual matter,” (Grant, 2015) allowing makers like myself, and hopefully viewers too, to reach a kind of “bodily understanding” (Roholt, 2014, p. 135) of the texts they consume.</p>\n<p><strong>Wokrs cited:</strong></p>\n<p>Grant, C., 2015.

      "body": "<p><strong>Special Pedagogy Issue: The TV Dictionary </strong></p>\n<p><em>Guest Editor's Introduction by Ariel Avissar</em></p>\n<p>This is the second of two special issues devoted to videographic pedagogy, highlighting student work. <a href=\"https://mediacommons.org/intransition/journal-videographic-film-moving-image-studies-104a-2023\">The first issue</a> showcased videos made by my own students in response to existing video essays; this issue presents and reflects on a curated selection of videos made by various students as part of the “<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/showcase/8660446/video/796127893\">TV Dictionary</a>,” a collaborative videographic project devoted to television. The project is premised on a simple prompt: each video attempts to capture the essence of a particular television series using a single word, by juxtaposing the dictionary definition(s) of that word with a clip or several clips from the series. I started it in July of 2021, and invited others to join in – which they did in spades; as of December 2023, 112 videos have been made by 50 makers worldwide; the collection as a whole or individual entries have received numerous mentions on <em>Sight &amp; Sound</em>’s best video essays polls for 2021 and 2022, and many others have expressed an interest in making their own entries, or in applying the prompt as part of their teaching.</p>\n<p>I believe at least part of the appeal of this parameter-based prompt, in the context of videographic TV studies, is in the (relatively) narrow focus dictated by the selection of a single word (and in many cases,  a single clip as well) – a welcome focus, as the long-form serial nature of television texts and the at times immense amount of raw material available can make videographic engagement seem daunting to begin with (for both the scholar and their editing platform). The project thus holds interest for scholars of television, videographic and otherwise, as an example of “<a href=\"http://mediacommons.org/intransition/2017/videographic-telephilia\">videographic telephilia</a>” that offers a productive range of avenues of engagement with televisual texts.</p>\n<p>While the prompt itself is quite simple, the various videos in the collection have responded to it in very different ways, applying a diverse range of formal and stylistic choices, at times sombre, at times playful; at times adopting the tone and language of the chosen series, at times deconstructing or subverting them. Some of the contributors are well-established videographic practitioners, who welcomed the opportunity to apply this new perspective on their own objects of research and fandom, in some cases incorporating their entries as part of their broader videographic and theoretical projects; for others, scholars and fans of television, this was a first dabble in videographic criticism, one that will hopefully lead to further experimentation with the form.</p>\n<p>In 2022, I sent out a special call for entries, inviting student contributions to the TV Dictionary. Out of the numerous student submissions made in response to the call, this issue presents a curation of seven videos that I felt made the best use of the premise of the project, and that opened new ways of looking at the material and of contextualizing it within broader frames of reference. This diverse offering represents, in my opinion, some of the best, most thoughtful, and most inventive work in the TV Dictionary as a whole. Each student’s work is presented alongside another entry from the collection, with which it shares certain formal, thematic, or generic characteristics. The pieces are also accompanied by creators’ statements by the student makers, and written reflections by the makers of the accompanying videos, reflecting on the students’ pieces and on their relation to their own. I hope this selection of videos and written reflections will serve to highlight the pedagogical potential of the TV Dictionary project, and will perhaps inspire other teachers to use it in class, and other students and makers to contribute to this ongoing endeavour.</p>\n"

      "body": "<p><strong>From Marcella to Arabella: Embracing “Handle” as a Framework for Systemic Change Beyond Neoliberal Resilience</strong></p>\n<p>The concept of resilience has faced criticism from feminist theorists such as Robin James, or Angela McRobbie, for promoting a neoliberal ideology that emphasizes individual success and ignores the role of structural issues in causing failure. The resilience paradigm implies that women and any marginalized group can overcome obstacles through sheer determination, failing to acknowledge the deep-seated systemic discrimination they face. The insufficiency of the discourse on resilience becomes glaring when we recognize that the problems of women's discrimination are far from isolated incidents; they are endemic and deeply entrenched in society. In this context, being resilient is a privilege. For Robin James, the resilience discourse can be countered by “unviable practices” such as melancholy, that is, a form of passive resistance: “not ‘winning’ but rather refusing to get over it” (63).</p>\n<p>By elaborating on Robin James’s thoughts, and on theories on the right to rage (Maseda, Gamez-Fuentes, Shonany, etc), in my video essay on the British TV show <em>Marcella</em>, I argue that anger is yet another way to disrupt the resilience discourse. However, by paraphrasing Judith Butler’s words, I wonder if it is possible to damage damaging forms of oppression through rage in the name of less damage. The hand that grabs Marcella on the brink of committing suicide at the end of my video essay—the hand that saves her from self-damage—becomes the evidence of our dependency upon each other, and of the strength that Butler has called “the force of non-violence.”</p>\n<p>Joy Hunter’s powerful video essay begins where my video essay ends: the noun (i.e. hand) becomes a verb (i.e. to handle): passivity and dependency become agency. Joy Hunter's important work articulates an invitation to move beyond the limitations of the resilience discourse. The concept of \"handle\" introduces a new framework, one that recognizes the systemic nature of discrimination while simultaneously empowering women to confront, transform, and engage with these deeply rooted challenges. \"Handle\" provides a holistic alternative that reframes women's agency in a way that encourages them to actively address and challenge oppressive structures, rather than merely enduring them. Hunter’s novel paradigm shift offers a much-needed pathway for feminist theory to transition from individualistic narratives to a more systemic perspective, ultimately working towards transformative change. By embracing \"handle,\" feminist discourse can take a significant step toward addressing the entrenched issues of discrimination and striving for a more just and equitable society.</p>\n<p><strong>Works cited:</strong></p>\n<p>Butler, Judith, y Athanasiou, Athena (2013). <em>Dispossession: The Performative in the Political</em>.
