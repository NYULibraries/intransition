  "body": "<p>Oswald Iten's “The Age of Emptiness” edits together shots from <em>The Age of Innocence</em> (Martin Scorsese, 1993) set to the familiar soundtrack of <em>Taxi Driver</em> (Scorsese, 1976), creating new meaning in the contemporary context of social distancing. As we leave social distancing further behind us, I tried to create something new; this time, by setting numerous shots from <em>I Am Love</em> (Luca Guadagnino, 2009) to the musical theme that accompanies Madam Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer) in <em>The Age of Innocence</em>. This is how I tried to bring to the surface the longing that inhabits Guadagnino’s film, combining images of spaces, food, nature, letters and more, with human touch.</p>\n<p>What drew me to Iten's work was its attention to details, the respect it affords them and the emphasis it places on their narrative significance. It is interesting to think of the underlying, hidden stories within every film, stories that are perhaps unconnected to the primary narrative, stories that are concealed between close ups of food, flowers, hands, gestures. The realization that these shots take up such a large portion of the film's runtime highlights their importance, their impact on the viewers, and above all – their beauty and the emotions they evoke.</p>\n<p>I chose to adapt the structure of Iten's work to the study of a film that for me triggered different – but not unrelated – associations in the context of the pandemic. If Scorsese's film, according to Iten, depicts a story of emptiness, Guadagnino's film adds to that a tragic but almost child-like longing for closeness. After many lockdowns, my own need to be closer to others was felt but almost unrealizable, as both internal and external distance took hold of my surroundings.</p>\n<p>The result came after a lengthy editing process, which put me in a trance-like state. I tried to produce an experience of movement, which would convey something of the passion hidden in the small details, the desires concealed beneath the surface of ordinary objects and gestures. I was moved by the thought that it might be possible, by connecting the many fragments from the film, to tell a larger story, an almost-universal story.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Biography:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Lia Dekel</strong> is a filmmaker and an undergraduate student at the Steve Tisch School of Film and Television, Tel Aviv University, studying in the school’s honors track.

      "body": "<p><strong>Special Pedagogy issue: Videographic Responses</strong></p>\n<p><em>Guest Editor's Introduction by Ariel Avissar</em></p>\n<p>This is the first of two special issues devoted to videographic pedagogy, highlighting student work. The current issue showcases and reflects on a selection of videos made by students of my own videographic criticism honors course at the Steve Tisch School of Film and Television at Tel Aviv University, between 2020 and 2022. One of the assignments I gave them was to respond videographically to an existing video essay of their choice, out of the numerous pieces highlighted in <em>Sight &amp; Sound</em>’s “best video essays” polls. Students were not given any further instructions on this assignment, and were free to respond in whichever way they saw fit to whichever video they felt a connection with.</p>\n<p>This assignment was met with enthusiasm, and the students went on to make dozens of response videos throughout each semester; it was a very effective way of getting them to discover new video essays, to reflect on their formal, structural and affective aspects and to devise diverse and original ways to respond to them: some chose to elaborate on the original video’s argument, others argued against it; some chose to enact experimentations designed to test the limits of the original video’s premise; and many chose to emulate the source videos, effectively “remaking” them, reverse-engineering their underlying functioning logic to extrapolate an algorithmic “script,” which could then be applied to alternative subject matters and media objects (a process which was particularly interesting in cases where two students responded to the same source video, as in a few of the examples featured here).</p>\n<p>Both the students and I were excited by the videos that resulted, and I went on to share them online, where they drew much interest and positive feedback, including from some of the makers of the source videos, who were honored to have their work responded to in such a way (needless to say, students were very excited to receive feedback from some of these makers!). Particularly during the long and stressful period of lockdown and isolation, I believe such a conversation was all the more welcome and appreciated, by both sides.</p>\n<p>This special issue hopes to continue this conversation; each student’s work is presented alongside the original work it responds to, and is accompanied by a creator’s statement by the student, and a written reflection by the maker of the original work. I hope this selection of videos and written reflections will serve to highlight the pedagogical value of this classroom assignment, and will perhaps inspire other teachers, students, and makers to employ it, further expanding on its dialogic potential.</p>\n"

      "body": "<p>Lia Dekel’s “The Age of Longing” responds to “The Age of Emptiness” by successfully appropriating its audiovisual concept in order to reflect on a later stage in our collective experience of the pandemic. When I first saw Dekel’s video, I was amazed by how closely she was able to adopt the dramatic structure of my video and still tell her own story. The resulting video not only works beautifully in its own right, but as a response, it also made me see my own video with new eyes. The fact that Dekel manages to tell her story without text (in half the time, I have to add!) makes me question my own use of written words on screen.</p>\n<p>Realizing that <em>I Am Love </em>(Guadagnino, 2009) devotes even more screen time to “shots devoid of human characters” than <em>The Age of Innocence </em>(Scorsese, 1993), I wonder whether the ratio of “empty” inserts to a film’s total duration is related to the average shot length or to contemporary editing practices in general. Of course, both “The Age of Emptiness” and “The Age of Longing” only work as reflections on social interaction (or the lack thereof) because they contain additional shots. While I tried to depersonalize the images of hands and silhouettes in “The Age of Emptiness,” Dekel personalizes even the architecture by confidently showing us the female protagonist at exactly the right moments. She keeps the focus on human touch by never showing any facial expressions, though.</p>\n<p>While I used Herrmann’s <em>Taxi Driver </em>(Scorsese, 1976) score to elicit danger and fear from the images of <em>The Age of Innocence</em>, in a genius turn, Dekel uses Elmer Bernstein’s yearning score from the latter film to bring out the longing in <em>I Am Love.</em> Madame Olenska’s theme not only emphasizes the connection between the two video essays, it also affects my perception of the images in a very different way than John Adams’s non-emotionalizing compositions that Guadagnino used to score his film. During the close-up of the shrimps, for example, the music perfectly encapsulates the sensuousness and passion that <em>I Am Love</em> conveys through selective sound design and close-ups of Tilda Swinton’s face. Bernstein’s musical theme may provide a strong structure for the overall flow; what makes “The Age of Longing” a fulfilling experience for me, however, is the <em>audiovisual </em>music, the editing, created with a sensitive ear.</p>\n"
