  "body": "<p>The first TV Dictionary entry I watched was on <em>The Chair</em>. <a href=\"/vimeo.com/591024276\">In his video</a>, Ian Garwood brought several definitions of the adjective “critical” into conversation with a single scene from the series, accentuating the scene’s tragically-comic tone while playfully drawing out some of the series’ thematic undercurrents. The structure and effect of the video essay having stuck with me since, I had similarly planned to use only a single scene for my own entry.</p>\n<p>Having watched <em>Maid</em>,[1] with its recurrences and echoes of space, this plan made less and less sense to me the more I thought about it. In my case, the advantage of showcasing separate but interlinked definitions of the noun “space” was that it allowed me to form interpretive connections between images appearing across the series. For instance, the second definition I use remains on-screen while clips from two separate episodes appear. In this instance, the verbal suggestion of confinement (“a limited extent”) acts as an interpretive bridge between a crawl space and a narrow hallway.</p>\n<p>Like <em>Maid</em>, I wanted to take the viewer on a journey through different arrangements of space. I also wanted to mirror the protagonist’s predicament by recreating an experience of claustrophobia and relief through editing. In this sense, I was consciously “adopting” <em>Maid</em>’s tone rather than “deconstructing or subverting” it. [2]</p>\n<p>As I rewatched my video essay in preparation for writing this statement, however, I discovered one area in which I had clearly diverged from the series. While the protagonist, Alex, is a vocal character throughout the show, it seems I’d essentially silenced her until the final episode. Only after the last definition of space – “the opportunity for privacy or time for oneself” – appears on-screen is Alex allowed to speak. In her monologue, she discusses her writing practice and the way it helps her to think, to feel.</p>\n<p>The fact that I included Alex’s monologue on the (re-)discovery of her voice while also making this her first act of verbal speech in the video was not the result of a conscious decision on my part. I had thought intensely about how I might structure the video essay in order to most effectively draw out the ways in which <em>Maid </em>centers on contended spaces. In short, while my process cannot be wholly described as “Make first, think later,”[3] it seems that any number of editing decisions will always occur before/around/underneath conscious thought, adding undercurrents of meaning that are felt rather than consciously articulated.</p>\n<p>[1] <em>Maid</em> 2021.

      "body": "<p><strong>Special Pedagogy Issue: The TV Dictionary </strong></p>\n<p><em>Guest Editor's Introduction by Ariel Avissar</em></p>\n<p>This is the second of two special issues devoted to videographic pedagogy, highlighting student work. <a href=\"https://mediacommons.org/intransition/journal-videographic-film-moving-image-studies-104a-2023\">The first issue</a> showcased videos made by my own students in response to existing video essays; this issue presents and reflects on a curated selection of videos made by various students as part of the “<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/showcase/8660446/video/796127893\">TV Dictionary</a>,” a collaborative videographic project devoted to television. The project is premised on a simple prompt: each video attempts to capture the essence of a particular television series using a single word, by juxtaposing the dictionary definition(s) of that word with a clip or several clips from the series. I started it in July of 2021, and invited others to join in – which they did in spades; as of December 2023, 112 videos have been made by 50 makers worldwide; the collection as a whole or individual entries have received numerous mentions on <em>Sight &amp; Sound</em>’s best video essays polls for 2021 and 2022, and many others have expressed an interest in making their own entries, or in applying the prompt as part of their teaching.</p>\n<p>I believe at least part of the appeal of this parameter-based prompt, in the context of videographic TV studies, is in the (relatively) narrow focus dictated by the selection of a single word (and in many cases,  a single clip as well) – a welcome focus, as the long-form serial nature of television texts and the at times immense amount of raw material available can make videographic engagement seem daunting to begin with (for both the scholar and their editing platform). The project thus holds interest for scholars of television, videographic and otherwise, as an example of “<a href=\"http://mediacommons.org/intransition/2017/videographic-telephilia\">videographic telephilia</a>” that offers a productive range of avenues of engagement with televisual texts.</p>\n<p>While the prompt itself is quite simple, the various videos in the collection have responded to it in very different ways, applying a diverse range of formal and stylistic choices, at times sombre, at times playful; at times adopting the tone and language of the chosen series, at times deconstructing or subverting them. Some of the contributors are well-established videographic practitioners, who welcomed the opportunity to apply this new perspective on their own objects of research and fandom, in some cases incorporating their entries as part of their broader videographic and theoretical projects; for others, scholars and fans of television, this was a first dabble in videographic criticism, one that will hopefully lead to further experimentation with the form.</p>\n<p>In 2022, I sent out a special call for entries, inviting student contributions to the TV Dictionary. Out of the numerous student submissions made in response to the call, this issue presents a curation of seven videos that I felt made the best use of the premise of the project, and that opened new ways of looking at the material and of contextualizing it within broader frames of reference. This diverse offering represents, in my opinion, some of the best, most thoughtful, and most inventive work in the TV Dictionary as a whole. Each student’s work is presented alongside another entry from the collection, with which it shares certain formal, thematic, or generic characteristics. The pieces are also accompanied by creators’ statements by the student makers, and written reflections by the makers of the accompanying videos, reflecting on the students’ pieces and on their relation to their own. I hope this selection of videos and written reflections will serve to highlight the pedagogical potential of the TV Dictionary project, and will perhaps inspire other teachers to use it in class, and other students and makers to contribute to this ongoing endeavour.</p>\n"

      "body": "<p>Upon rewatching Radman’s entry on <em>Maid</em> and my own on <em>Severance</em>, I find myself wondering how these pieces might have looked like if their respective words had been switched; after all, various definitions of both “space” and “break” seem equally apropos to both, and I find the choice of word in all TV Dictionary entries to always be, on some level, somewhat arbitrary. These parallels and unexpected connections, these fortuitous linkages between and across words, between and across television series, in various pairings and endless combinations, are for me part of the appeal of television viewing – and of the TV Dictionary collection.</p>\n<p>Many entries in the TV Dictionary – starting with the very first one I myself made, on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/573450694\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Fargo</em></a> – are comprised of just one, continuous clip from their chosen television text. This approach makes the dauting task of videographic engagement with serial narratives somewhat less daunting, which also contributes to the succinctness and conceptual focus of many of these pieces. And yet, it is fortunate that Radman’s initial idea to do the same here ended up discarded for a much more elaborate edit of clips taken from an entire season of television. The result, while undoubtedly more time consuming to produce, is highly rewarding to watch. It is an insightful, in-depth and sensitive character study.</p>\n<p>My own entry on <em>Severance</em> also plays as a character study<em>. </em>While Radman and I have created two very different entries, some striking similarities occurred to me in watching them together. Both pieces weave together clips taken from multiple episodes in a non-linear fashion (though Radman’s piece does create a more coherent sense of narrative whole, whereas mine is constructed in a more fragmented, abstracted fashion). Both focus on female characters who find themselves trapped, both figuratively and literally. These women are trapped within circumstances they have little control over, trapped within lives they feel alienated from, trapped by various domineering institutions and (male) oppressors, trapped within enclosed, claustrophobic spaces. Indeed, both pieces are comprised primarily or exclusively of clips shot indoors, featuring compositions that frame the female characters as visually contained within tight spaces, as shown, for example, in the following images:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"255\" src=\"http://mediacommons.org/intransition/sites/default/files/Maid-Severance.png\" width=\"506\" /></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"////Users/damorton/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image001.png\" />Moreover, in both pieces the female characters are silenced – not only by the institutions and circumstances that seek to control them, but also by the edit, as Radman has herself addressed in her written statement. But while in my entry, Helly R is entirely voiceless, Radman ultimately allows Alex a reclaiming of her voice and of her narrative. Whereas both our pieces portray these women’s attempts at breaking free from their varied form of confinement, Radman’s offers a way out. Mine… does not. In my edit, Helly R remains isolated and helpless; Radman shows how Alex finds solace, support, and a safe “space.”</p>\n"
