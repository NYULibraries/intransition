  "body": "<p><strong>By Richard <span word=\"Misek\" data-scaytid=\"4\">Misek</span></strong></p>\n<p>This video is a response to Justin <span word=\"Remes’s\" data-scaytid=\"7\">Remes’s</span> article <a href=\"https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/cinema_journal/v054/54.3.remes.html\" target=\"_blank\">‘Boundless <span word=\"Ontologies\" data-scaytid=\"5\">Ontologies</span>: Michael Snow, Wittgenstein, and the Textual Film’</a>, in the current issue of <em>Cinema Journal</em> [i]. The article explores the particular phenomenon within experimental film history of ‘textual’ films – films whose images focus on the written word. Using Michael Snow’s <em>So Is This </em>(1982) as his main exemplar, <span word=\"Remes\" data-scaytid=\"9\">Remes</span> discusses how textual films play with language and with the very concept of film.</p>\n<p>I’ve read the article several times now, and – as with all the best academic writing – have found it to inspire new questions on each reading. One question in particular that it has inspired me first to ask, and then (through this video) to try to answer, is: what precisely, or even imprecisely, does the word ‘film’ refer to? Watching Snow’s idiosyncratic fusion of cinema, graphic design, and word game, it’s hard not to agree with <span word=\"Remes\" data-scaytid=\"11\">Remes</span> that, ‘[i]n the <span word=\"post-Wittgensteinian\" data-scaytid=\"13\">post-Wittgensteinian</span> universe that Snow inhabits, neither words nor films have single fixed meanings, functions, or essences – rather, concepts are fluid and in a state of continual flux.’</p>\n<p>A current example of this semantic fluidity is the word ‘movie’. The word refers both to commercial feature films and to the digital files on which almost all films (and far more besides) now reside. Though an essentialist might regard this as a problem, for everyone else it barely registers. In any particular context, we understand what the word refers to not because of an ontologically-specific definition of ‘movie’ but because of its context.</p>\n<p>Is ‘film’ a similarly amorphous word?</p>\n<p>I think not – at least, not yet. This video outlines why, in my view, the word ‘film’ retains a certain <span word=\"definitional\" data-scaytid=\"14\">definitional</span> specificity. It does so through a combination of my own words and those of Hollis <span word=\"Frampton\" data-scaytid=\"15\">Frampton</span>. <span word=\"Frampton\" data-scaytid=\"17\">Frampton</span> was Snow’s contemporary in the American experimental film scene of the <span word=\"1960s\" data-scaytid=\"20\">1960s</span> and <span word=\"70s\" data-scaytid=\"21\">70s</span>, and also made films that explored the written (and spoken) word. Though his themes were similar to Snow’s, his techniques were quite distinct. For example, one of <span word=\"Frampton’s\" data-scaytid=\"22\">Frampton’s</span> recurrent techniques is that of structuring films around a disjunction. In <em>Nostalgia </em>(1971), the disjunction is between sound and image: nine images of photographs are accompanied by nine stories, each describing the image that will next appear on screen [ii]. In <em>Poetic Justice </em>(1972), the <span word=\"disjuntion\" data-scaytid=\"25\">disjuntion</span> is between the images in the film and those in our heads: handwritten on-screen text describes a series of scenes that become progressively more difficult for the viewer to <span word=\"visualise\" data-scaytid=\"26\">visualise</span>. Through such <span word=\"disjunctions\" data-scaytid=\"29\">disjunctions</span>, rather than creating an audiovisual harmony in which different stylistic elements (<span word=\"camerawork\" data-scaytid=\"30\">camerawork</span>, editing, music, etc.) speak in one voice, <span word=\"Frampton\" data-scaytid=\"32\">Frampton</span> puts different formal elements of his films into <span word=\"dialogue\" data-scaytid=\"35\">dialogue</span> with each other. Sometimes these elements agree with each other, sometimes they don’t.</p>\n<p>To my mind, Frampton’s and Snow’s films exist in a similar dialogue. Perhaps conscious of this affinity, in both <em>Nostalgia </em>and <em>A Lecture </em>(1968), <span word=\"Frampton\" data-scaytid=\"42\">Frampton</span> got Snow to recite his text [iii]. Analogously, the video you are (I hope) about to watch explores the same themes as <span word=\"Remes\" data-scaytid=\"44\">Remes</span>, but approaches them using a different technique. It’s quite a wordy video, yet still nowhere near wordy enough to be able to respond to <span word=\"Remes’s\" data-scaytid=\"45\">Remes’s</span> superb analysis point by point [iv]. Nonetheless, I hope that in some ill-defined way, echoing Snow’s and <span word=\"Frampton’s\" data-scaytid=\"49\">Frampton’s</span> films, it too may exist in <span word=\"dialogue\" data-scaytid=\"52\">dialogue</span> with the article that inspired it.</p>\n<p><strong>Endnotes</strong></p>\n<p>[i] <a class=\"ext\" href=\"https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/cinema_journal/v054/54.3.remes.html\" target=\"_blank\">Justin Remes, “Boundless </a><a class=\"ext\" href=\"https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/cinema_journal/v054/54.3.remes.html\" target=\"_blank\">Ontologies: Michael Snow, Wittgenstein, and the Textual Film”, <em>Cinema Journal</em>, 54.3, Spring 2015</a></p>\n<p>[ii] For an extensive account of this common trope in experimental and art film, see Peter <span word=\"Wollen\" data-scaytid=\"59\">Wollen</span>, “Mismatches of Sound and Image”, in <em><span word=\"Soundscape\" data-scaytid=\"62\">Soundscape</span>: The School of Sound Lectures 1998-2001</em>, <span word=\"eds\" data-scaytid=\"63\">eds</span>. Larry <span word=\"Sider\" data-scaytid=\"64\">Sider</span>, Diane Freeman, and Jerry <span word=\"Sider\" data-scaytid=\"66\">Sider</span> (London and New York: Wallflower Press, 2003).</p>\n<p>[iii] <em>A Lecture</em> was presented at Hunter College, New York on October 30, 1968, and reprinted in <em>The <span word=\"Avant-Garde\" data-scaytid=\"69\">Avant-Garde</span> Film: A Reader of Theory and Criticism, <span word=\"ed\" data-scaytid=\"70\">ed</span>.

It’s a shame that <span word=\"Frampton\" data-scaytid=\"72\">Frampton</span> never spoke the text in one of Snow’s own works in return. If he had, perhaps they could have swapped audio tracks and created a truly <span word=\"structuralist\" data-scaytid=\"76\">structuralist</span> <span word=\"dialogue\" data-scaytid=\"75\">dialogue</span> between their work.</p>\n<p>[iv] For purely academic interest, this introduction to my video already features more words than the video itself.</p>",

It actually helps me to get past some of the discomfort I've felt in referring to my video works as \"films\" (the film purist/materialist in me cringes a bit at the thought). But the term \"film\" has certainly evolved from its material origins, as this piece nicely explicates."
