  "body": "<p>In fall 2017, I was invited by Tonspur Kunstverein Wien to make an eight-channel sound installation in a public passageway at Vienna’s MuseumsQuartier. I wanted to make a sound piece about the apartment in Vienna on Novaragasse where three generations of my Jewish family lived until 1939. My great-grandmother, a family matriarch, lived in this apartment along with my grandfather and his siblings and later my grandmother, my uncle, and my mother in utero. Several of these family members were later deported to concentration camps.</p>\n<p>My surviving family members were prohibited from reclaiming or entering this home when they returned to Vienna post-war. During my fall 2017 art residency, I unexpectedly gained access to the house and to my family’s apartment through a friend of a friend who lives in the building. With the help of archivists, I learned that Nazis forcibly removed Jewish inhabitants from this and other buildings and then used this building as a deportation house. The records showed the names of people crammed into my family’s apartment, #20, until these temporary residents were transported to Theresienstadt and killed.</p>\n<p>I had done prior radio work in Vienna connected to the idea of Holocaust postmemory, the intergenerational transmission of war, trauma, and displacement (Hirsh, 2012). My radio pieces became increasingly experimental as I engaged with this theme of postmemory. I wandered the city of Vienna, telling stories I had not personally experienced but which informed me physically and emotionally. I drew on the methodology of evocative autoethnography (Bochner, 2017) to frame this intangible experience of violence, loss, and the transmission of anxiety and psychological defenses.</p>\n<p>Before my residency in fall 2017, I consulted a medium to get input about doing a radio piece about this family house. The medium said there were wandering spirits stuck in the house who could use some help. I would make the MuseumsQuartier sound installation to help the ghosts find peace, but first I wanted to better understand <em>what is a ghost?</em></p>\n<p>Scholars, among them Jacques Derrida and sociologist Avery Gordon, have brought interdisciplinary perspectives to the study of ghosts.<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\" id=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a> Gordon’s work compellingly frames haunting in the context of systemic oppression: Haunting “is the price paid for violence, for genocide...Erasure and defacement concoct ghosts” (Gordon, 2008, 5). Gordon posits that an arduous bodily transformation is required to address a haunting, a process that is not only intellectual but requires an individual encounter: “[I]f you think you can fight and eliminate the systems’ complicated ‘nastiness’ without [an encounter], you will not get very far because it will return to haunt you” (Gordon, 2008, 203).</p>\n<p>To learn about Jewish practices for assisting ghosts, I consulted a rabbi and a Jewish community leader in Vienna. They both pointed me towards soul letters, a Kabbalistic practice of reciting psalms associated with the letters of the deceased person’s name. 220 people were deported from the Novaragasse house, so the safest bet was to recite psalms that covered every letter. To this end, I recorded the Jewish community leader and his mother reciting Psalms 34 and 121, and this recording is part of <em>Covenant of the Tongue</em>.</p>\n<p>Soul letters brought me to the very rich world of Kabbalah. I was especially drawn to Abraham Abulafia (Idel, 1987), a 13<sup>th</sup> century Jewish mystic from Spain who created vocalized meditations based on the ancient <em>Sefer Yetzirah</em>, or Book of Creation, a stunning text that resonates with contemporary speech act and performativity of language theories (Butler, 1997; Law and Urry, 2004). <em>Sefer Yetzirah</em> is about the power of the breath, letter, and word to form the world. Through permutations of sounded letters, one chisels and engraves the air (Kaplan, 1990). The utterance is a sensual, profoundly creative act through the portal of the mouth.</p>\n<p>Abulafia’s engagement with the <em>Sefer Yetzirah</em> provided me with a language for encountering the Novaragasse house’s past and present. In particular, I wanted to define myself and my family members not in terms of the acts of annihilation and violence done in the house but on my own creative terms. This is not easy to do in Vienna as a Jewish person, where Holocaust ghosts and history are still palpable, and there are now very few Jews in Vienna. Abulafia’s meditations enabled me to acknowledge history while simultaneously asserting and enacting my living presence and creative power.</p>\n<p>Most of the vocalizations chanted by me throughout <em>Covenant of the Tongue</em> are permutations of the three “mother” letters, aleph, mem, and shin, which birth the other letters, twenty-two in total. (Kaplan, 1990). I let myself be rearranged through the vocalizations, which I did many nights while making this piece, often chanting them at two in the morning at top volume. I felt pulled to use my body “to eliminate the system’s nastiness,” borrowing Gordon’s phrase. I felt the vibrations in various cavities of my body --my head, my torso, my legs-- as I permuted the three mothers and other letters. Day by day, amidst the pressure of an art opening, an offering was birthed. Things emerged in the sound piece that I had not controlled or intended. The various encounters and strange late nights helped my self get out of the way.</p>\n<p>My originally imagined audience of <em>Covenant of the Tongue</em> was a mix of ghosts from the Novaragasse house; the living Viennese walking through the public passageway in the MuseumsQuartier, many of whom were disconnected from this recent history; and, as strange as it sounds, the particles of air and matter affected by vibration, invited to be formed anew. I also imagined friends and other humans as listeners creating the resonant container that makes sound come alive, the sonic equivalent of bearing witness.</p>\n<p><em>Covenant of the Tongue</em> opened in December 2017 and was composed specifically for eight channels in the above-mentioned passageway at the MuseumsQuartier. I had observed how people moved through the passage, often walking quickly in the cold weather on their way somewhere. I worked with the acoustics of the passage’s vaulted ceiling that sustain a singing voice and the encompassing sound of eight channels in the space.  The passageway version was an eighteen-minute loop and included seven images mounted on the wall, photos of the Novaragasse house’s hallways and interior staircase with text from the <em>Sefer Yetzirah</em> superimposed.  For <em>[In]transition</em>, which presents a different listening space than a Viennese passageway, some of the repeating elements of the piece have been removed. I also shortened and thinned other sections.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>References</p>\n<p>Blanco, M. &amp; Peeren, E. (Eds.).

      "body": "<p><em>[in]Transition is pleased to present this special issue on audiographic criticism, guest edited by Neil Verma and Jacob Smith. This issue represents a distinct innovation for the journal, removing the moving images that have been at the core of videographic criticism. Jason Mittell shepherded the issue for the journal, and offers thanks to Neil, Jacob, and their contributors &amp; reviewers for their excellent work. </em></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"#bottom\">Scroll down</a> past the introduction to directly access the audiographic essays.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Critical Audiography: Lessons of a “Stereophonic” Approach</strong>   </p>\n<p>About twelve miles West of Charing Cross station, in the London borough of Hillingdon, lies the town of Hayes. If you were visiting there in the winter of 2018, you would have found a large construction site just steps from the light rail station, part of a £250 million redevelopment with high rises and midrise towers that will include 642 homes, a cinema and a performance venue. It’s called the Old Vinyl Factory, for good reason. In the 20<sup>th</sup> century the recording giant EMI had a factory here, where they pressed and packaged famous records by the Beatles and Pink Floyd. Today, developers are milking this heritage for all it’s worth. On the wall of a lounge on the first floor of one set of flats blazes an orange neon sign reading “Record Store,” although no dusty albums are for sale. Between buildings sit concrete benches shaped like record players, with stylized steel tonearms as elbow rests. A stretched-fabric mural covers a car park with images of screaming teenage Beatles fans, while iconic Brit rock lines are painted across low walls (“Put on your red shoes and dance the blues” “There’s nothing you can do that can’t be done”). And there in the center of it all is a two-story sculpture harkening back to an even earlier era, one that any sound studies scholar or music buff would know instantly: Nipper, the charming terrier from Francis Barraud’s 1899 <em>His Master’s Voice</em> logo used by Victor Records and the Gramophone Company Ltd in the U.K., an early global icon of music on disc.</p>\n<p>It is striking that, like many modern homages to the famous image, the sculpture bungles the whole idea. Because there is no Victrola horn into which Nipper’s quizzical gaze and billowing ears are directed – no source of the “master’s voice” in <em>His Master’s Voice</em> – the miracle promised by recording technology is lost. This is supposed to be a dog communing with its lost owner whose voice has been preserved on a cylinder or disc, a terrier testifying to the fidelity of mechanized sound by performing fidelity to his master. But the device emblematizing that preservation is nowhere to be seen (at least, nothing had been put in place as of 2018). In trying to honor the legacy of 20<sup>th</sup> century musical recording technology (or to squeeze out any nostalgia left for it), the sculpture only depicts its absence. At the Old Vinyl Factory lofts, faithful old Nipper is listening to something that isn’t there.  </p>\n<p>Thinking about sonic absences – specifically about listening for forms that should be there but aren’t  – captures something we experienced as we developed this special double issue of <em>[in]Transition </em>focusing on academic thought that takes the form of digital sound. In 2017 the editors of this publication generously offered us the incredible opportunity to use this unique platform to bring focus to emerging digital practices that are a sonic corollary of videography, and that we are calling “audiography”: a form that leverages digital technology to use the very materials of audio media in order to present research <em>about</em> audio media. The desire to explore the audiographic as an expressive mode seemed inevitable, in part thanks to the rise of podcasts in academic settings, both in and out of the classroom, where many professors and creators are no longer satisfied with using digital recording for mere lecture capture, and instead wish to incorporate its emerging social forms and technological affordances into the shape of their argumentation. Indeed, audiography has already taken hold, with podcasts like SCMS’s <a href=\"http://www.aca-media.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Aca-Media</em></a>, Stanford’s <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/state-of-the-human/id518898586\" target=\"_blank\"><em>State of the Human</em></a>, Mack Hagood’s <a href=\"http://phantompod.org/about-us-2/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Phantom Power</em></a> and Lance Dann and Martin Spinelli’s <a href=\"https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/for-your-ears-only-martin-spinelli-and-A2ilweVf0yj/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>For Your Ears Only</em></a>, as well as shows from the nonacademic world that explore a range of sound phenomena, such as <a href=\"https://www.20k.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Twenty Thousand Hertz</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.radiodramarevival.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Radio Drama Revival</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.youmustrememberthispodcast.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>You Must Remember This</em></a> and <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/masterclass_podcast\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Masterclass</em></a>. If podcasts such as those represent “audio” art moving into the space of “graphic” textuality, online textual forms are increasingly importing linked or even embedded audio to help make arguments. Examples include <a href=\"https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/558606/558607\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Journal of Sonic Studies</em></a>, <a href=\"https://ro.uow.edu.au/rdr/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>RadioDoc Review</em></a>, and especially <a href=\"https://soundstudiesblog.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Sounding Out!</em></a><em>,</em> which for a decade has been a pioneer of “doing” sound studies through the integration of sonic elements that help explore the relationship between sound and social difference.  </p>\n<p>There are antecedents to this kind of work. One need only look to the practices of acoustic ecologists, field recordists, sound artists and deep listening practitioners (we are thinking here of Annea Lockwood, Hildegard Westerkamp, Mendi + Keith Obadike or Pauline Oliveros), and radio feature-making and sound documentary (the work of Alan Hall, Joe Richman and Cathy FitzGerald, for instance) to see clear elements of a sharp critical sensibility embedded in formal practices oriented to audiences beyond the walls of the academy. A quirky antecedent from the domain of media studies can be found in Marshall McLuhan’s Columbia LP “The Medium is the Massage” (1968), which attempts to use sound effects, music, and multiple speakers to convey the texture of contemporary media culture. A more contemporary effort that resonates with many works in this issue is the <a href=\"https://citiesandmemory.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Cities and Memory</u></a> project, which since 2014 has mapped thousands of sounds from 80 countries around the world along with “reimaginings” of each recording, pieces that often land somewhere between art and theory. In our own program in Sound Arts and Industries at Northwestern we encourage students to communicate sound studies and sound science using sound media, and our regional organization the Great Lakes Association for Sound Studies (GLASS) includes critical soundwalks and experimental recording as part of its ambit. Jacob Smith’s recent project <em>ESC: Sonic Adventure in the Anthropocene</em> (University of Michigan Press, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.10120795\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.10120795</a>), uses audio as the medium for an eco-critical analysis of the CBS Radio adventure series <em>Escape</em> (1947–54), and demonstrates that a place exists for audiographic criticism in the domain of academic publication.</p>\n<p>Yet even in all these current examples and antecedents, there seemed no universal model of what audiographic work might sound like, no recipe or set of parameters about what to record, how to record it, how to mix it and present it, how to legitimize it and cite it, how to integrate sound tracks with text, the degree of scholarly apparatus to import – to name just a few thorny methodological, theoretical and technical problems the audiographer faces and that set her apart from other kinds of academic creators. Our thought was that an open call process might yield such a model, and that this platform could play a crucial role in enshrining it. After all, as its mission statement explains, <em>[in]Transition </em>is a platform not only to present work, but to give it disciplinary validation to “create a context for understanding” a form. Like Nipper in Barraud’s painting, we had the opportunity to listen to, and potentially legitimize an innovation, to “recognize” it on behalf of the disciplines of sound and media studies.</p>\n<p>In the end, however, it turned out we were more like the Nipper at the Old Vinyl Factory site than the Nipper on the classic logo, in that our attention focused less on a unified object, and more on a suggestive absence. Despite our intention to locate a singular blueprint for audiographic work, we found that no single submission we received felt like its shape and method could be exportable to the circumstances of one of the others, and that there was therefore no concrete formula before us. This was a blessing in disguise. In this issue, you will find a stunning variety of contexts, materials and engagements, testifying to the breadth and ambition of sound studies today. Our audiographers used sound as an entry way to fresh explorations of feminist <em>avant garde</em> artwork, themes of refugee experience and of nomadism, textures of vernacular experience ranging from teenage videos to spaces of elegiac memory, remediations from cinema to podcasting, issues of preservation, and sonic activism in the wake of recent travel bans. In contexts from Ohio to Vienna, from Syria to Bangalore, our authors cover topics including migrant experiences of “orientation,” ciné-mix cultural habits as an expression of a viewing itinerary, haptic aesthetics in women’s vocal performance, podcast archiving, and communion with postmemorial ghosts.</p>\n<p>While there may not have been a dominant defining mode to the contributions in this special issue, we heard some important themes emerging as it took shape. As Jonathan Sterne has observed, the capacious curiosity of sound students is often met by an equally energized self-awareness of their own positional partiality (Sterne 2012, 4). In this case, while our group of audiographers have wide-ranging interests and disciplinary affiliations, they share an awareness that their academic work is “positioned” by attending media forms. As our responses point out in the articles that follow, each author seems to have selected one or two sonorous forms as an “other” that their argumentative and expressive intervention emulates, draws upon or stands in tension with. Thus audiographies in this issue reflect and inflect sonic forms we already recognize, including academic talks, DVD commentaries, radio documentaries, audiobooks, radio interviews, sound installations, fandubs and more. If we are looking for a single, common form of the audiography itself, we may be out of luck on this outing. Other than taking the form of an audio track supported by a textual statement, these pieces have little in common thematically. But they do share a gesture: each one reaches from an established expressive audio form toward a mode of scholarly critical engagement, or reaches from an established mode of scholarly engagement toward an established expressive audio form. In this way, audiographers trace a line across a gulf, but they do so in a way that need not blaze a permanent path. In negotiating the space between scholarly practice and the audio arts, audiographers create overlaps that are curiously unexpected, impermanent, and ad hoc. For this reason, we view the submissions in this issue as lessons in how, within the context of a particular political or intellectual project, a creator can negotiate between what it takes to make sound work and what it takes to make sound think. </p>\n<p>Audiography as we understand it means using recording and mixing as <em>intellectual</em> tools, as essential components in the act of making an academic argument with the audio form in mind; as opposed to using sound as an afterthought. Audiography negotiates making sound work and making sound think, and so links an evolving scholarly discourse with an evolving genre of audio. To capture this interwoven “two-channel\" aspect of audiography we might consider another part of the history of the EMI factory in West London. A generation before The Beatles and a generation after the Nipper painting, the Hayes site was not just a working factory but also a laboratory, one of the key sites (along with Bell Labs) in which concepts and models for stereophonic sound were developed. Legendary engineer Alan Blumlein worked on this site when EMI was formed in 1931, the same year he filed his famous patent 394, 325, which defined some 70 separate processes, materials, and methods for how to record and transduce two-channel stereo recordings. In fact, the train you take to get to the Old Vinyl Factory lofts runs along the same line on which Blumlein and his team recorded one of the <a href=\"https://www.emiarchivetrust.org/trains-at-hayes-the-worlds-first-stereo-film-made-in-1935-clip/\" target=\"_blank\">earliest stereophonic films</a>.  Of course, experiments in binaural and stereophonic sound had been around for more than a century by then, deriving their logic from what Théberge, Divine and Everett call the historical rise of the spatialized acoustic subject (See Théberge, Divine and Everett 2015). In the 1930s, stereo was still ahead of its time as a commercial matter – most of Blumlein’s techniques were unused until after the patent expired in 1952 and stereo returned as a music technique in the late 1950s (Anderson 2006; Schmidt Horning 2015). Among Blumlein’s key insights in this lineage was to work out the mathematics that converts the <em>phase difference</em> of a sound that hits two recording sources at the same time into an <em>amplitude difference</em>, which gives many listeners the illusion of dimensionality (Burns 2000). This was one of several techniques EMI labs devised that allowed for creating a stereo spread that could be produced using only two loudspeakers, without resulting in the “hole in the middle” that had bedeviled previous systems.</p>\n<p>Much has been written about the way two-channel stereo rationalizes a certain relation to the world through the construction of “sweet spots” for listening along with new aesthetics for “realism” and gendered hierarchies of experience in it (see Grajeda 2015; Keightley 1996). The recording process that creates that effect remains grounded in concepts developed at Hayes and places like it in the mid 20<sup>th</sup> century, but today it can be achieved through a range of configurations: using two omnidirectional mics spaced from one another; two cardioid microphones placed at 90-degree angles one atop the another; dummy head configurations, that create a dead zone where the flesh and skull of a listener might be, producing “3-D” audio; and more recent ambisonic technologies designed to push beyond stereophonic applications and into VR (see Virostek 2013, 189-96). However they are configured, though, the idea of stereophonic representation is rooted in the material fact of two slightly different perceptions occurring at once, captured at a common rate, across a small but perceptually significant gulf of space or time. The stereo recordist’s art is to find a way to stitch those two nearly identical experiences together into a form that resolves them, an artificial and temporary unity of perception.</p>\n<p>This, we wish to submit, is an apt metaphor for the dilemma of the audiographer, and one that each creator in this issue resolves in their own way. On the one side, there is scholarship, and all the propositional and non-propositional ways that academics go about producing, processing, disrupting, circulating and storing knowledge. On the other side are a myriad of expressive sound forms – from audiobooks to seances, podcasts to field recordings – that give the audiographer a form to work in, and a potential listening public to reach. Audiography, for us, is what happens when these two resonating entities overlap and create a temporary illusion of a center derived from the margins. We said above that this special issue doesn’t have a hard and fast <em>model</em> for potential audiographers, but it does have a series of <em>lessons</em> in the way each creator uses her unique position between a discourse and an expressive form to create her own sweet spot based on material and method. In aggregate, these works also have a philosophy, one we might liken to post-Blumlein stereophonic practices: it is <em>by virtue of</em> an absent center to the genre – and not in spite of it – that critical audiographic logics may emerge.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Works Cited</strong></p>\n<p>Anderson, Tim. 2006. <em>Making Easy Listening: Material Culture and Postwar American Recording</em>.

      "body": "<p>Karen Werner’s <em>Covenant of the Tongue</em> is among our most experimental works, arriving at the form of critical practice after having iterated through other expressive registers and personal explorations. It is adapted from a radio piece and a site-specific sound installation; it also has qualities both of choral song and of spoken poetry -- note the way Werner uses mic technique to sensuously explore words we know like “palate,” “teeth” and “lips,” alongside melodious Hebrew letters. And that is not all. The piece also powerfully functions as an audiographic project inflected by auto-ethnographic and critical performance practice methods (on the latter, see Eidsheim 2019). Given the subject matter, it is surely fitting that this version of the work is itself something of a passageway haunted by its antecedents.</p>\n<p>Anna Friz writes in her curatorial essay that she wishes she could hear the sound of the empty room where Werner’s audio piece was created, the sonic ground for <em>Covenant of the Tongue</em>. If postmemory is Werner’s mode, spaces and their occupants are her fascination – the Novaragasse house, the Viennese public passageway, particles of air and matter themselves, ghosts. This may serve as a reminder that audiography that draws inspiration from installation needs to reflect upon the situated nature of all theorizing, and the need to be mindful of how critical analysis reverberates and resonates in different spaces and contexts. Werner’s powerful idea of performed utterance as “offering” will surely inspire future audigraphers.</p>\n<p>In its use of the voice, <em>Covenant of the Tongue</em>, makes an interesting comparison with Amy Skjerseth’s analysis of Yoko Ono. Both take the semantic and musical forms of the voice to a place of extreme eccentricity as a mode of intervention. For Werner, that involves breaking language down into microscopic particles of speech that she “chisels and engraves” into the air, opening up ethical, poetic and sensuous fields. Where Skjerseth heard a “haptic audio-visuality” in Ono’s vocalizations that facilitated an embodied communication with listeners, Werner’s vocal practice aims at finding a means to communicate with or through the ghosts of the past through these highly articulated particles of sound. Friz points out that sound and radio art are often bound up with the paradox of presence and absence, and this is true both of bodies and of voices. <em>Covenant</em> may belong in the tradition of works exploring the connection between sound and memory, beginning perhaps with spiritualist Sir Oliver Lodge, one of radio’s key inventors, who a hundred years before Werner also sought out a spiritualist medium to help him communicate with a son he lost, and in the process helped to invent the modern concept of ether, forever tying it to radiophonic esoterica (Lodge, 1916).</p>\n<p><strong>Work Cited</strong></p>\n<p>Eidsheim, Nina. 2019. <em>The Race of Sound</em>.

      "body": "<p>Karen Werner's <em>Covenant of the Tongue</em> explores place and memory through utterance as an avowal of the continuing presence of her family history, expressed as consistent and multi-generational in spite of the trauma which the Holocaust inflicted upon her ancestors and upon subsequent generations of survivors. Werner seeks to avoid building a narrative of victimization in favor of addressing the material and poetic experiences of presence and absence in place, particularly in her mother's family house in the city of Vienna from the which the family were exiled.</p>\n<p>Sound and radio works more generally are concerned with the paradox of presence and absence that characterize the circumstances of such media: voices emerge from technological bodies into spaces that are distant from one another; listeners and speakers must experience and parse distances in order to be in relationship. In the early days of radio transmission and audio recording media, spiritualist beliefs proliferated alongside their development and some people believed that these emerging communications media might enable special congress with spirits or ghosts of the dearly departed, much as a séance was meant to engage the ghosts of a haunted house. The German word for uncanny is “unheimlich”, the negation of “heimlich”, which in turn is a word containing both reference to home and to secrecy. “Unheimlich” therefore suggests that which is neither homely nor secret, rendering the uncanny as both uncomfortable and potentially revelatory. These shades of meaning seem very apt when considering Werner's intentions for this piece: she explores the building where her family lived in Vienna before being displaced and disappeared under Nazism, and by returning to this site she encounters an uncomfortable intersection of past and present in a house which is no longer home, and where acts of persecution are obscured but not secret. She begins with the question, what is a ghost?  And by extension, how are we to listen in this space of discomfort, and what may be revealed?</p>\n<p>The space of the entrée, in an apartment building, on a street corner, in a neighborhood, becomes a resonant setting for self-reflexive sonic experiments. Speech acts animate the space and allow the listener to experience the material body of memory in the form of the descendent, sounding back to ancestors and forward into the attention of the present. Werner's re-worlding of her family's former home in Vienna centers around her spoken utterances of letters and words from the Kabbalistic text Sefer Yetzirah, applying the performative aesthetics from sound poetry collaged with field recordings,  brief samples from interviews, and a thick, nearly continuous backdrop of static. Here I'm missing the inclusion of the empty room tone of this same space before or after Werner inhabits it with her voice —even if sounds of the everyday in the space are entirely banal and sometimes so minimal to be almost silent—as this contrast would allow listeners to more precisely feel the change in sonic state which Werner's performativity enables.</p>\n<p>Werner is committed to thinking ethically through sound; therefore, in addition to the tradition of the divine speaker as world-maker, she makes audible the complicity of the listener in world-making. The first step of empathic communication is the capacity for listening by both witnesses and by the one who is sounding. Werner's listening is attentive to inter-generational site-specificity in relationship to ancestors, actions, history, memory, and place; her composition brings listeners gradually into acquaintance with her process of listening, testing, tasting, uttering, and to the affirmation of presence which her voice enables, re-materializing in the space.</p>\n<p><strong>Reviewer Bio:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://nicelittlestatic.com\" target=\"_blank\">Anna Friz</a> is a Canadian sound and radio artist and media studies scholar.
