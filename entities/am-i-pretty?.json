  "body": "<p><strong><em>Am I Pretty?</em></strong><strong> and a “Sonic Gaze”</strong></p>\n<p>Recently, a colleague remarked to me that he feels dishonest if he says “yes” when asked whether he’s read a certain book, when in fact he listened to the audiobook version rather than examined a textual version. “The natural presumption,” philosopher William Irwin says on the difference between reading words and listening to them, “seems to be that listening is easier than reading, and what is harder is better” (Irwin 2009, 360). But this feeling of betrayal of the written word also speaks to the primacy of the visual in our culture, which, of course, discounts the long oral history of storytelling before and after the invention of written text. The suggestion further is that if the body and the eyes are active while consuming words, as they so often are when we’re listening to verbal texts– we are driving, running, cleaning, etc. while we listen to our favorite podcasts or radio news – then our brain can’t sustain intellectual focus. Listening, through this cultural lens, is a secondary activity.</p>\n<p>My aging eyes and the strain of life in front of screens has recently led me to explore alternative ways of reading, namely listening to an author’s audio version of a book while scanning the corresponding pages of text. The result has been revelatory for me, creating a deeper relationship between me, the texts, and the authors themselves. The experience has reoriented me to the written word in a way that forces me out of my own head, out of my own approach to cadence and prosody and pronunciation, and into that of another’s, often in ways that startle me into a new interpretation of the text. Even a simple difference in my expectation of hearing the word “route” (“root”) as I see the word on the page, only to hear “rout” instead, can jostle me into a state of challenged assumptions about my own interpretation of a text and expectations about the author.</p>\n<p>I came to this film, “Am I Pretty?” with a similar goal of reorientiation of the relationship between sound an image. In this case, I sought a redirection of the expectant gaze of the spectator and to upend the primacy of the visual assumed in the cinematic experience. Although this piece contains minimal visuals to provide a blank(ish) canvas for the eye, sound drives it, with our focus as viewer/listeners on the timbre, cadence, accent, and dialect variations in the voices we hear on the soundtrack. Using found sound to build connections and reveal patterns among the experiences of young women, this piece produces an audiographic comment on contemporary girl culture in the online context.</p>\n<p>The “Am I Pretty?” meme that forms the basis of the audio for this piece peaked in popularity in 2012, with hundreds of tween girls in English-speaking countries (my focus here) uploading videos to YouTube requesting and even demanding the evaluation of their appearance by YouTube viewers. Most girls emphasized needing honest feedback, and, significantly, wanting to know “the truth,” as if YouTube commenters were the ultimate trustworthy arbiters of such judgments. Although the meme has largely petered out, in 2017, such videos were still occasionally being uploaded.</p>\n<p>My interest in these uploads stemmed in part from their demand of a gaze, and my own discomfort – and despair – in watching them, and recognizing that to whatever extent they inspired my compassion and empathy, I couldn’t help but have always, in the back of my mind, a sense of my own appraisal of their appearance. Yet, ethically, as a filmmaker I couldn’t work with the visuals. I wasn’t willing to be complicit in a visual culture that inspires this kind of self-judgement about young women’s looks, or to put these girls in a vulnerable or exploited position by using their images. By focusing only on their voices, which grants them a certain level of anonymity, I seek to explore the mechanism by which we as listeners almost involuntarily imagine what a person looks like based on the sound of their voice, especially in a case like this where the words we hear demand a visual assessment. The piece encourages such mental visualization by including sections in which the young women provide vivid details about their appearances – braces on tiny teeth, unbrushed hair, dimples – to ask us to reflect on the visual assumptions we make about what we’re hearing.</p>\n<p>The film therefore shifts the responsibility for the visual track of the film from the maker onto the viewer, and in doing so makes gazing an ethical concern. As we listen, it is nearly impossible not to consider some kind of answer to the question: “am I pretty?” When placed in the position of pondering a response to this question based solely on voices, we become aware of our own complicity in perpetuating the social norms of female “prettiness” because we know, on some level, that the mental picture we paint is informed powerfully by them. With little else to go on, we fall back on social heuristics.</p>\n<p>It’s worth noting, as well, that research in evolutionary psychology has revealed and continues to reveal the significance of the voice in human perceptions of attractiveness and judgments of personality (see, for instance, Wells, Dunn, et al, 2009). Unsurprisingly, voice pitch is linked in part to hormonal influences, which in turn correlates with our assessment of the reproductive fitness of the speaker – their desirability – as well as their benevolence or dominance. So, even if we attempt to listen to these young women with a neutral ear, primal forces shape our expectations about the appearance and attractiveness of the speaker – forces that the film invites us to call into question.</p>\n<p>Although the tweens in these audio clips share quite a lot of sadness, to be clear, they also present an impressive range of personality traits and emotional expressions. As quickly as they’re despairing about their looks, they’re championing their favorite bands or breaking into song. They’re distracted by something in their rooms or laughing at their own jokes. They’re in a state of conflict, at that moment when the self-assuredness of early youth meets the social pressures of young adulthood, and we hear the tug-of-war between these life stages playing out in their words. Some are deeply uncertain of their status among their peers, while others are resolute in their confidence and treat the game of “am I pretty?” as something of a joke. Some are clearly working hard to maintain a sense of self-esteem in the face of critics and bullies with varying levels of success. Within this set of representations, the film seeks to demonstrate the complexity of the interior lives of young women even as it underscores the seriousness of their singular question.</p>\n<p>The ending, then, in which a young woman declares that she truly thinks she is beautiful, is more ragged and layered than it might seem at first blush. It raises questions about what genuine self-esteem sounds like and how we, as listeners, interpret a statement a person makes about what she thinks of herself. In many cases, these girls seem to be engaging in therapeutic self-talk, to bolster their own confidence by making positive declarations about themselves out loud to an audience, or, in other cases, to express self-doubt in the hopes of being supported by their viewers. Yet, it’s not clear who these YouTubers envisioned as their audiences – their peers at school? at large? other women? men? –and in many cases these videos had under five views. So, it’s easy to imagine that these videos were not made with much of an audience in mind at all, but for themselves only, to express their anxieties, to provide a channel for self-affirmation, or to share intimate feelings that couldn’t be shared anywhere else. Those seemingly simple words – “I truly think I’m beautiful” – are therefore more about a process these young women are engaging in, rather than a state of being or a goal achieved.</p>\n<p>As a filmmaker this film has posed a challenge because I am in the privileged, or disadvantaged, position of having not only seen all these videos, but studied their visual content. I can’t unsee these videos, and I can’t unlink their sound from their visual referents. This inability to undo presents a creative obstacle because I can’t predict what a fresh spectator might experience. Nonetheless, as a piece that investigates the impact of sound on our relationship with (non)images and documents the soundscape of young women in a meme on YouTube, “Am I Pretty?” attempts, for new audiences, to invert the spectatorial position to the screen by insisting that sound serve as the image-generator, and to embolden the voices of tween girls whose experiences of self-doubt are so often dismissed.</p>\n<p><strong>Works Cited</strong></p>\n<p>Irwin, William. \"Reading Audio Books.\" <em>Philosophy and Literature</em>, vol. 33 no. 2, 2009, pp. 358-368.

      "body": "<p><em>[in]Transition is pleased to present this special issue on audiographic criticism, guest edited by Neil Verma and Jacob Smith. This issue represents a distinct innovation for the journal, removing the moving images that have been at the core of videographic criticism. Jason Mittell shepherded the issue for the journal, and offers thanks to Neil, Jacob, and their contributors &amp; reviewers for their excellent work. </em></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"#bottom\">Scroll down</a> past the introduction to directly access the audiographic essays.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Critical Audiography: Lessons of a “Stereophonic” Approach</strong>   </p>\n<p>About twelve miles West of Charing Cross station, in the London borough of Hillingdon, lies the town of Hayes. If you were visiting there in the winter of 2018, you would have found a large construction site just steps from the light rail station, part of a £250 million redevelopment with high rises and midrise towers that will include 642 homes, a cinema and a performance venue. It’s called the Old Vinyl Factory, for good reason. In the 20<sup>th</sup> century the recording giant EMI had a factory here, where they pressed and packaged famous records by the Beatles and Pink Floyd. Today, developers are milking this heritage for all it’s worth. On the wall of a lounge on the first floor of one set of flats blazes an orange neon sign reading “Record Store,” although no dusty albums are for sale. Between buildings sit concrete benches shaped like record players, with stylized steel tonearms as elbow rests. A stretched-fabric mural covers a car park with images of screaming teenage Beatles fans, while iconic Brit rock lines are painted across low walls (“Put on your red shoes and dance the blues” “There’s nothing you can do that can’t be done”). And there in the center of it all is a two-story sculpture harkening back to an even earlier era, one that any sound studies scholar or music buff would know instantly: Nipper, the charming terrier from Francis Barraud’s 1899 <em>His Master’s Voice</em> logo used by Victor Records and the Gramophone Company Ltd in the U.K., an early global icon of music on disc.</p>\n<p>It is striking that, like many modern homages to the famous image, the sculpture bungles the whole idea. Because there is no Victrola horn into which Nipper’s quizzical gaze and billowing ears are directed – no source of the “master’s voice” in <em>His Master’s Voice</em> – the miracle promised by recording technology is lost. This is supposed to be a dog communing with its lost owner whose voice has been preserved on a cylinder or disc, a terrier testifying to the fidelity of mechanized sound by performing fidelity to his master. But the device emblematizing that preservation is nowhere to be seen (at least, nothing had been put in place as of 2018). In trying to honor the legacy of 20<sup>th</sup> century musical recording technology (or to squeeze out any nostalgia left for it), the sculpture only depicts its absence. At the Old Vinyl Factory lofts, faithful old Nipper is listening to something that isn’t there.  </p>\n<p>Thinking about sonic absences – specifically about listening for forms that should be there but aren’t  – captures something we experienced as we developed this special double issue of <em>[in]Transition </em>focusing on academic thought that takes the form of digital sound. In 2017 the editors of this publication generously offered us the incredible opportunity to use this unique platform to bring focus to emerging digital practices that are a sonic corollary of videography, and that we are calling “audiography”: a form that leverages digital technology to use the very materials of audio media in order to present research <em>about</em> audio media. The desire to explore the audiographic as an expressive mode seemed inevitable, in part thanks to the rise of podcasts in academic settings, both in and out of the classroom, where many professors and creators are no longer satisfied with using digital recording for mere lecture capture, and instead wish to incorporate its emerging social forms and technological affordances into the shape of their argumentation. Indeed, audiography has already taken hold, with podcasts like SCMS’s <a href=\"http://www.aca-media.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Aca-Media</em></a>, Stanford’s <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/state-of-the-human/id518898586\" target=\"_blank\"><em>State of the Human</em></a>, Mack Hagood’s <a href=\"http://phantompod.org/about-us-2/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Phantom Power</em></a> and Lance Dann and Martin Spinelli’s <a href=\"https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/for-your-ears-only-martin-spinelli-and-A2ilweVf0yj/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>For Your Ears Only</em></a>, as well as shows from the nonacademic world that explore a range of sound phenomena, such as <a href=\"https://www.20k.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Twenty Thousand Hertz</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.radiodramarevival.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Radio Drama Revival</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.youmustrememberthispodcast.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>You Must Remember This</em></a> and <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/masterclass_podcast\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Masterclass</em></a>. If podcasts such as those represent “audio” art moving into the space of “graphic” textuality, online textual forms are increasingly importing linked or even embedded audio to help make arguments. Examples include <a href=\"https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/558606/558607\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Journal of Sonic Studies</em></a>, <a href=\"https://ro.uow.edu.au/rdr/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>RadioDoc Review</em></a>, and especially <a href=\"https://soundstudiesblog.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Sounding Out!</em></a><em>,</em> which for a decade has been a pioneer of “doing” sound studies through the integration of sonic elements that help explore the relationship between sound and social difference.  </p>\n<p>There are antecedents to this kind of work. One need only look to the practices of acoustic ecologists, field recordists, sound artists and deep listening practitioners (we are thinking here of Annea Lockwood, Hildegard Westerkamp, Mendi + Keith Obadike or Pauline Oliveros), and radio feature-making and sound documentary (the work of Alan Hall, Joe Richman and Cathy FitzGerald, for instance) to see clear elements of a sharp critical sensibility embedded in formal practices oriented to audiences beyond the walls of the academy. A quirky antecedent from the domain of media studies can be found in Marshall McLuhan’s Columbia LP “The Medium is the Massage” (1968), which attempts to use sound effects, music, and multiple speakers to convey the texture of contemporary media culture. A more contemporary effort that resonates with many works in this issue is the <a href=\"https://citiesandmemory.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Cities and Memory</u></a> project, which since 2014 has mapped thousands of sounds from 80 countries around the world along with “reimaginings” of each recording, pieces that often land somewhere between art and theory. In our own program in Sound Arts and Industries at Northwestern we encourage students to communicate sound studies and sound science using sound media, and our regional organization the Great Lakes Association for Sound Studies (GLASS) includes critical soundwalks and experimental recording as part of its ambit. Jacob Smith’s recent project <em>ESC: Sonic Adventure in the Anthropocene</em> (University of Michigan Press, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.10120795\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.10120795</a>), uses audio as the medium for an eco-critical analysis of the CBS Radio adventure series <em>Escape</em> (1947–54), and demonstrates that a place exists for audiographic criticism in the domain of academic publication.</p>\n<p>Yet even in all these current examples and antecedents, there seemed no universal model of what audiographic work might sound like, no recipe or set of parameters about what to record, how to record it, how to mix it and present it, how to legitimize it and cite it, how to integrate sound tracks with text, the degree of scholarly apparatus to import – to name just a few thorny methodological, theoretical and technical problems the audiographer faces and that set her apart from other kinds of academic creators. Our thought was that an open call process might yield such a model, and that this platform could play a crucial role in enshrining it. After all, as its mission statement explains, <em>[in]Transition </em>is a platform not only to present work, but to give it disciplinary validation to “create a context for understanding” a form. Like Nipper in Barraud’s painting, we had the opportunity to listen to, and potentially legitimize an innovation, to “recognize” it on behalf of the disciplines of sound and media studies.</p>\n<p>In the end, however, it turned out we were more like the Nipper at the Old Vinyl Factory site than the Nipper on the classic logo, in that our attention focused less on a unified object, and more on a suggestive absence. Despite our intention to locate a singular blueprint for audiographic work, we found that no single submission we received felt like its shape and method could be exportable to the circumstances of one of the others, and that there was therefore no concrete formula before us. This was a blessing in disguise. In this issue, you will find a stunning variety of contexts, materials and engagements, testifying to the breadth and ambition of sound studies today. Our audiographers used sound as an entry way to fresh explorations of feminist <em>avant garde</em> artwork, themes of refugee experience and of nomadism, textures of vernacular experience ranging from teenage videos to spaces of elegiac memory, remediations from cinema to podcasting, issues of preservation, and sonic activism in the wake of recent travel bans. In contexts from Ohio to Vienna, from Syria to Bangalore, our authors cover topics including migrant experiences of “orientation,” ciné-mix cultural habits as an expression of a viewing itinerary, haptic aesthetics in women’s vocal performance, podcast archiving, and communion with postmemorial ghosts.</p>\n<p>While there may not have been a dominant defining mode to the contributions in this special issue, we heard some important themes emerging as it took shape. As Jonathan Sterne has observed, the capacious curiosity of sound students is often met by an equally energized self-awareness of their own positional partiality (Sterne 2012, 4). In this case, while our group of audiographers have wide-ranging interests and disciplinary affiliations, they share an awareness that their academic work is “positioned” by attending media forms. As our responses point out in the articles that follow, each author seems to have selected one or two sonorous forms as an “other” that their argumentative and expressive intervention emulates, draws upon or stands in tension with. Thus audiographies in this issue reflect and inflect sonic forms we already recognize, including academic talks, DVD commentaries, radio documentaries, audiobooks, radio interviews, sound installations, fandubs and more. If we are looking for a single, common form of the audiography itself, we may be out of luck on this outing. Other than taking the form of an audio track supported by a textual statement, these pieces have little in common thematically. But they do share a gesture: each one reaches from an established expressive audio form toward a mode of scholarly critical engagement, or reaches from an established mode of scholarly engagement toward an established expressive audio form. In this way, audiographers trace a line across a gulf, but they do so in a way that need not blaze a permanent path. In negotiating the space between scholarly practice and the audio arts, audiographers create overlaps that are curiously unexpected, impermanent, and ad hoc. For this reason, we view the submissions in this issue as lessons in how, within the context of a particular political or intellectual project, a creator can negotiate between what it takes to make sound work and what it takes to make sound think. </p>\n<p>Audiography as we understand it means using recording and mixing as <em>intellectual</em> tools, as essential components in the act of making an academic argument with the audio form in mind; as opposed to using sound as an afterthought. Audiography negotiates making sound work and making sound think, and so links an evolving scholarly discourse with an evolving genre of audio. To capture this interwoven “two-channel\" aspect of audiography we might consider another part of the history of the EMI factory in West London. A generation before The Beatles and a generation after the Nipper painting, the Hayes site was not just a working factory but also a laboratory, one of the key sites (along with Bell Labs) in which concepts and models for stereophonic sound were developed. Legendary engineer Alan Blumlein worked on this site when EMI was formed in 1931, the same year he filed his famous patent 394, 325, which defined some 70 separate processes, materials, and methods for how to record and transduce two-channel stereo recordings. In fact, the train you take to get to the Old Vinyl Factory lofts runs along the same line on which Blumlein and his team recorded one of the <a href=\"https://www.emiarchivetrust.org/trains-at-hayes-the-worlds-first-stereo-film-made-in-1935-clip/\" target=\"_blank\">earliest stereophonic films</a>.  Of course, experiments in binaural and stereophonic sound had been around for more than a century by then, deriving their logic from what Théberge, Divine and Everett call the historical rise of the spatialized acoustic subject (See Théberge, Divine and Everett 2015). In the 1930s, stereo was still ahead of its time as a commercial matter – most of Blumlein’s techniques were unused until after the patent expired in 1952 and stereo returned as a music technique in the late 1950s (Anderson 2006; Schmidt Horning 2015). Among Blumlein’s key insights in this lineage was to work out the mathematics that converts the <em>phase difference</em> of a sound that hits two recording sources at the same time into an <em>amplitude difference</em>, which gives many listeners the illusion of dimensionality (Burns 2000). This was one of several techniques EMI labs devised that allowed for creating a stereo spread that could be produced using only two loudspeakers, without resulting in the “hole in the middle” that had bedeviled previous systems.</p>\n<p>Much has been written about the way two-channel stereo rationalizes a certain relation to the world through the construction of “sweet spots” for listening along with new aesthetics for “realism” and gendered hierarchies of experience in it (see Grajeda 2015; Keightley 1996). The recording process that creates that effect remains grounded in concepts developed at Hayes and places like it in the mid 20<sup>th</sup> century, but today it can be achieved through a range of configurations: using two omnidirectional mics spaced from one another; two cardioid microphones placed at 90-degree angles one atop the another; dummy head configurations, that create a dead zone where the flesh and skull of a listener might be, producing “3-D” audio; and more recent ambisonic technologies designed to push beyond stereophonic applications and into VR (see Virostek 2013, 189-96). However they are configured, though, the idea of stereophonic representation is rooted in the material fact of two slightly different perceptions occurring at once, captured at a common rate, across a small but perceptually significant gulf of space or time. The stereo recordist’s art is to find a way to stitch those two nearly identical experiences together into a form that resolves them, an artificial and temporary unity of perception.</p>\n<p>This, we wish to submit, is an apt metaphor for the dilemma of the audiographer, and one that each creator in this issue resolves in their own way. On the one side, there is scholarship, and all the propositional and non-propositional ways that academics go about producing, processing, disrupting, circulating and storing knowledge. On the other side are a myriad of expressive sound forms – from audiobooks to seances, podcasts to field recordings – that give the audiographer a form to work in, and a potential listening public to reach. Audiography, for us, is what happens when these two resonating entities overlap and create a temporary illusion of a center derived from the margins. We said above that this special issue doesn’t have a hard and fast <em>model</em> for potential audiographers, but it does have a series of <em>lessons</em> in the way each creator uses her unique position between a discourse and an expressive form to create her own sweet spot based on material and method. In aggregate, these works also have a philosophy, one we might liken to post-Blumlein stereophonic practices: it is <em>by virtue of</em> an absent center to the genre – and not in spite of it – that critical audiographic logics may emerge.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Works Cited</strong></p>\n<p>Anderson, Tim. 2006. <em>Making Easy Listening: Material Culture and Postwar American Recording</em>.

      "body": "<p>Jennifer Proctor begins her artist’s statement by describing how her experience of audiobooks prompted new ideas about reading, texts, and authors. If sound studies is a field that has become adept at “thinking across sounds,” it is apt that an experience of audiobooks was one of the inspirations for Proctor’s imageless film, <em>Am I Pretty?</em>, which seeks to similarly reorient our experience of a decidedly visual genre of online video. Proctor’s “masking” of the image produces a profusion of affective and critical results, and highlights the tangle of voice and image relationships inherent to this online phenomenon. We hear young women presenting themselves for visual assessment in order to elicit textual comments from strangers that they hope will give them a more authentic verdict than what they <em>hear</em> from those who are co-present around them (notice how often they refer to what “people” or “friends” are “saying”).</p>\n<p>The multiplicity of these voices and the common, yet also deeply singular, experiences they relate (and perform) harkens back to much older “kaleidosonic” forms of auditory narration that since the golden age of radio have fascinated audiences by arraying a series of vocal types across shallow sonic spaces connected by segues (Verma 2012). Historically this rhetoric has both depicted a mutually sympathetic coalition and requested listeners to join with it as an imagined community, summoned into existence and actuated by sound. If that comparison is apt, Proctor’s intervention in the genre may be to show how that sort of politics is shortcircuited, or at least deferred, by our own habit of attaching our own “visual assumptions” based on traces within the voice and its recording method. This aspect of the work recalls a key passage in Derek Jarman’s famous 1993 film <em>Blue</em>, which like <em>Am I Pretty?</em> consists of a single color visual focalizing an audio voice-over, in which Jarman’s narrator reflects on a suspicion toward the image, one that finds a special articulation in the world of sound: “The image is a prison of the soul, your heredity, your education, your vices and aspirations, your qualities, your psychological world.”</p>\n<p>As Kiri Miller points out, there is a sense of hope in the final statement in the recording, which feels like a moment when we are hearing someone at last listening to themselves, using the process of posting a video – a form that ostensibly uses the internet as a visual mirror meant to confirm social ideas about body image – as an acoustic mirror, hearing the sound of their own thoughts exteriorized. It would be naïve to task this self-present voice with helping us escape from the prison of the body. That’s impossible. But when it comes to the prison of the soul, there may be some hope.</p>\n<p><strong>Works Cited</strong></p>\n<p>Verma, Neil. 2012. <em>Theater of the Mind: Imagination, Aesthetics and American Radio Drama</em>.

      "body": "<p>“Hi, um…You all know who I am—well, maybe you <em>don’t</em>.” Listen: it’s all the ambivalent intimacy of social media, summed up by a young woman who is preparing to ask us to assess her appearance. In “Am I Pretty?” Jennifer Proctor reinforces YouTube uploaders’ obsession with the evaluative gaze through repetitive juxtaposition, while redacting visual content with a pink screen. The work is a sonic remediation of a digital video meme from 2012: the unfolding audio narrative models the experience of clicking through a stream of videos and making sense of the patterns that emerge. “Am I Pretty?” might be considered a transmedia ethnography; it represents and interprets one media world using the materials and techniques of another. Proctor asks us to listen to the nuances of voices and ambient sounds to reconstruct a complex social world captured at a particular moment.</p>\n<p>Proctor speculates that we will be sucked into the practices of judgment that these young women request of us, imagining how they look no matter how hard we try not to. Vocal timbre, regional accents, pitch, up-speak, and even microphone technique all led me to reflect on what constitutes “pretty girl” vocal affect. But the more powerful experience came in hearing the video makers guide me toward their “pretty” or “ugly” features. This is what got me thinking about this piece as ethnographic: “Am I Pretty?” requires us to understand these girls’ beauty standards in the terms that they provide. Their accounts express the maddening unknowability of “pretty” through fluency in specific signs of “ugly”: being “fat,” a “whale,” a “thing”; having very curly hair, a big forehead and tiny teeth, blemishes or uneven eyebrows. Being pretty, on the other hand, might involve hair, eyes, smiles, body shape, and makeup, but what exactly makes these features pretty is hard to say. Both good makeup <em>and</em> looking good without makeup are pretty. “Chubby thighs” are ugly—except another girl loves her “fat thighs” and says that guys do, too. The one universal truth about “pretty” seems to be that only other people can assess it. Unfortunately, friends, family, and bullies all have their own reasons to lie, so the most trustworthy evaluators are strangers on the internet and boys who ask you out. (“Am I Pretty?” depicts a resolutely heteronormative world.)</p>\n<p>Proctor’s last speaker sounds relatively mature and confident. Her voice is lower in pitch and measured in pace; she describes bullying in the past tense. She still asks for our opinions, but also tells us, “In all honesty, I think I’m beautiful.” I hear her voice as African American, and with her final lines there is a visual fade from pink screen to black—a “Black is beautiful” confluence that makes for a hopeful ending. But we haven’t grown out of asking “Am I pretty?” since 2012. Rather, the question is so baked into the social media infrastructure of Facebook likes, Instagram hearts, and Tinder swipes that it no longer needs to be asked explicitly. Proctor’s work makes this question strange again by inviting us to listen to it sound out loud, over and over.</p>\n<p><strong>Reviewer Bio:</strong></p>\n<p>Kiri Miller is Professor of American Studies and Music at Brown University.
