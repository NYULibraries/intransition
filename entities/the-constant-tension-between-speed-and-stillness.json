  "body": "<p>Grace Lee's thought-provoking essay \"The Speed (and Stillness) of Being Online\" discusses the evolution of viewers' perceptions of media, by the criteria of speed\\stillness. Lee's main approach, as I understand it, is pointing out the main shift in this issue during the development of digital media, especially when visual-based social media and content (such as YouTube videos, memes, and Tik-Tok loops) have become so ubiquitous. While the dominant discourse would make it seem as though the introduction of mass digital media into our world can be associated with the preference of speed slow, long-term processes that characterize pre-digital times, Lee's video presents a more complex picture.</p>\n<p>Towards the end of essay, Lee: \"This is an era increasingly defined, not by speed or stillness, but the constant tension between the two. Where speed is emotionally loved but intellectually despised, and slowness is intellectually admired but emotionally feared.\" This statement was really stimulating to me at that point in time, as an undergraduate student in film and television studies, stuck on her couch during the Covid-19 pandemic. During that time, I was thinking, as many did, of being as creative and productive as I be and of watching all the artsy, “important” kinds of movies I never got around to . But Facebook and YouTube were much more accessible and instantaneous, and required much less mental effort and commitment. As I watched Lee's essay, I immediately thought of Delphine Seyrig as Jeanne Dielman, peeling potatoes quietly in Chantal Akerman's famous film.</p>\n<p>For me, <em>Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du commerce, 1080 Bruxelles</em>(1975) is one the most challenging movies in terms of slowness, be sure which words related to which video. The sound of the video is taken from <strong><em>Whiplash</em></strong> (2014), and is meant to rhythmically complement the surplus of the image.</p>\n<p>The result of this image experiment was quite surprising. While I was pretty sure that the change of pace would \"destroy\" the sequences and make them into parodies of themselves, I realized it actually helped to point out hidden qualities in them. On the right, Syrig's performance became much more neurotic, goal-oriented and irate. On the left, the \"Tasty\" video became even more \"pornographic\" and . In that way, putting into experiment the constant tension between speed and stillness made me rethink my preexisting assumptions, and I hope it might make others rethink theirs.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Biography:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Katia Arieli </strong>is a Master's student and teaching assistant at the Steve Tisch School of Film and Television, Tel Aviv University, studying in the school’s honors track.</p>\n",

      "body": "<p><strong>Special Pedagogy issue: Videographic Responses</strong></p>\n<p><em>Guest Editor's Introduction by Ariel Avissar</em></p>\n<p>This is the first of two special issues devoted to videographic pedagogy, highlighting student work. The current issue showcases and reflects on a selection of videos made by students of my own videographic criticism honors course at the Steve Tisch School of Film and Television at Tel Aviv University, between 2020 and 2022. One of the assignments I gave them was to respond videographically to an existing video essay of their choice, out of the numerous pieces highlighted in <em>Sight &amp; Sound</em>’s “best video essays” polls. Students were not given any further instructions on this assignment, and were free to respond in whichever way they saw fit to whichever video they felt a connection with.</p>\n<p>This assignment was met with enthusiasm, and the students went on to make dozens of response videos throughout each semester; it was a very effective way of getting them to discover new video essays, to reflect on their formal, structural and affective aspects and to devise diverse and original ways to respond to them: some chose to elaborate on the original video’s argument, others argued against it; some chose to enact experimentations designed to test the limits of the original video’s premise; and many chose to emulate the source videos, effectively “remaking” them, reverse-engineering their underlying functioning logic to extrapolate an algorithmic “script,” which could then be applied to alternative subject matters and media objects (a process which was particularly interesting in cases where two students responded to the same source video, as in a few of the examples featured here).</p>\n<p>Both the students and I were excited by the videos that resulted, and I went on to share them online, where they drew much interest and positive feedback, including from some of the makers of the source videos, who were honored to have their work responded to in such a way (needless to say, students were very excited to receive feedback from some of these makers!). Particularly during the long and stressful period of lockdown and isolation, I believe such a conversation was all the more welcome and appreciated, by both sides.</p>\n<p>This special issue hopes to continue this conversation; each student’s work is presented alongside the original work it responds to, and is accompanied by a creator’s statement by the student, and a written reflection by the maker of the original work. I hope this selection of videos and written reflections will serve to highlight the pedagogical value of this classroom assignment, and will perhaps inspire other teachers, students, and makers to employ it, further expanding on its dialogic potential.</p>\n"

      "body": "<p>Katia Arieli’s experimental video is an excellent expansion on, and demonstration of, the non-linear relationship between speed and time. Even with their timecodes condensed or stretched, each clip retains the markers of its intended consumption. The “Tasty” video is elongated, but all it emphasises are the frames it leaves out, and the scene from Chantal Akerman's film is accelerated but becomes no easier to engage with. From this, it becomes even clearer that speed is as much about quantity as it is delivery, making food the ideal vessel of these images, folding in the question of just how and what we’re consuming – our essence, our dependence. It’s the perfect choice to consider the base, instinctive desires that lie underneath consumption, and the constant anxiety around the impact on our health, whether physical or mental.</p>\n<p>It also provides the perfect companion to my original video as it contrasts the contextual platforms of Youtube and Vimeo, the former for its association with quick fix gluttony and the latter for its refined palate. Despite Arieli’s shorter run time, there’s no denying the video’s minimalist presentation is more in keeping with the slow ethos of arthouse and academia - and yet, it conveys its message in far less time than my high-speed locomotive of a Youtube video. So what are we really measuring?</p>\n"
