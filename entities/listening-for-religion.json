  "body": "<p><strong>Statement by Lauren Pond, Multimedia Producer for the American Religious Sounds Project (with contributions by Isaac Weiner)</strong></p>\n<p>The American Religious Sounds Project (ARSP), a collaborative research initiative co-directed by Amy DeRogatis (Michigan State University) and Isaac Weiner (The Ohio State University), asks a fundamental question: What can we learn about religion if we begin by listening for it? But this first question also begs a second: What is religious sound?</p>\n<p>Often, when thinking about religion, it is devotional sounds that come to mind: the Islamic call to prayer, the clanging of church bells, the chanting of Buddhist monks. These sounds are easily coded as “religious,” perhaps because they unfold at recognized institutions, or because they are associated with formal practices. But what about the rhetoric of a street preacher shouting at passers-by? Or ambient kitchen noise during the preparation of a sacred meal? The ARSP often encourages recordists and listeners to use a more discerning ear – to attend to unexpected manifestations of religion, and to the ways it moves beyond traditional boundaries and interacts with its surroundings.</p>\n<p>This audiography was produced with these ideas in mind. Three audio collages explore ways that multiple religious traditions – evangelical Christianity, Orthodox Christianity, and Islam – come into contact with various physical, cultural, and political contexts. Traditional devotional sounds are secondary or totally absent in most cases, encouraging both recordist and listener to focus on the intersection of religion with other spheres, and the insights that this may yield.</p>\n<p>The first piece focuses on a bustling TA Travel Center in Lodi, Ohio, and the presence of a chapel therein. Transport for Christ (TFC), an evangelical trucker ministry, has placed dozens of these so-called “mobile chapels” (semi-tractor trailers-turned houses of worship) at truck stops across the nation. The Lodi chapel provides on-call chaplains, regular worship services, and Bible study sessions, which are attended primarily by truck drivers.</p>\n<p>Audio captures parts of a Sunday service at the TFC chapel, during which a chaplain exhorts drivers not to fall for human deceit, and to embrace kindness, humility, meekness, and love; it also captures the conclusion of the service, when the chaplain leads the hymn “Amazing Grace” and offers a prayer for one driver’s neck pain. But in the collage, these more expected devotional sounds unfold against a backdrop of idling trucks, whose engines roar in the parking lot just outside the chapel; the steady hum of travel center refrigerators, stocked with cold beverages; and the idle chatter of the politicians and infomercials that drivers are watching on television. On the road in his truck cab, driver Pete Douglas vocalizes his frustration with the contemporary trucking industry, including its lower pay and longer hauls.</p>\n<p>This sonic combination invites listeners to understand the TFC mobile chapel as an entity integrated into truck driver life and responsive to its challenges. It also alludes to the growing efforts of evangelical Christianity to leave traditional institutions and “meet people where they are.” Not only do the chaplains’ words speak directly to some of the issues drivers encounter and provide encouragement for the road; the quiet of the chapel interior stands in sharp contrast to the din of the truck stop, suggesting that this is a place of calm and respite - if only a temporary one.</p>\n<p>The second piece sonically depicts preparations for a Lenten fish dinner in the basement of Columbus, Ohio’s St. Stevan of Dechani Serbian Orthodox Church. In preparation for Easter, many Christians observe Lent through introspection, self-evaluation, fasting, and abstention, including from rich foods like red meat.  Churches may serve milder meals as an alternative, and in American institutions, fish is often the focus.  At the St. Stevan’s parish, volunteers collaborate for several hours in the church’s kitchen to cook platters of baked and fried fish, seasoned potatoes, and coleslaw, among other dishes, all made from scratch and free of meat and dairy products.</p>\n<p>In this collage, what might normally be considered background noise comes to the foreground: the chopping of vegetables for Serbian dishes, traditional music, excited conversations in native tongues. These ambient details add new layers of meaning, alluding, for instance, to the strong ethnic ties of this parish, its celebration of its Eastern European heritage, and its simultaneous embrace of American traditions . Alternatively, the sounds are a reminder that community and convivial sociality are as foundational to whatever we might consider religious as are the formal worship practices occurring in the church sanctuary above.</p>\n<p>The third and final piece documents a protest against then-newly inaugurated President Donald Trump’s first travel ban, which targeted Muslim-majority countries. The public reaction to the ban was swift and loud, with protests erupting immediately at airports nationwide in January 2017, including at the John Glenn International Airport in Columbus, Ohio. On a bitterly cold afternoon, hundreds of people, many of them Muslim, gathered on the airport grounds and marched to the main terminal. There, different Muslims took turns using a megaphone to denounce discrimination and bigotry.</p>\n<p>First, by focusing on this intersection of Islam and protest, the collage calls listeners’ attention to the increasing politicization of Islam and Muslims in recent years. But the acoustics in the physical space of the protest are also deeply symbolic. At the outset, one hears movement: the sounds of participants walking, the roar of jet engines, and the rhyme and meter of protest chants, such as: “No ban, no reg-is-try, no white su-prem-a-cy.” As protesters reach the airport terminal, the sonic experience changes drastically. Individual voices merge into an undulating, encompassing soundscape, into waves of sound that ricochet off of concrete barriers and drown out all other noise. Fittingly, this protest against religious immobility evokes the sense of being trapped.</p>\n<p>And yet, there is also something reassuring about this ricocheting sea of voices. Within these concrete confines, protesters’ individual voices combine to form a powerful, communal one, a unified statement against bigotry and Islamophobia. One senses a communal energy and growing resistance that cannot be quelled.</p>\n<p><strong>Bio:</strong></p>\n<p>Lauren Pond is a documentary artist who specializes in faith and religion.

      "body": "<p><em>[in]Transition is pleased to present this special issue on audiographic criticism, guest edited by Neil Verma and Jacob Smith. This issue represents a distinct innovation for the journal, removing the moving images that have been at the core of videographic criticism. Jason Mittell shepherded the issue for the journal, and offers thanks to Neil, Jacob, and their contributors &amp; reviewers for their excellent work. </em></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"#bottom\">Scroll down</a> past the introduction to directly access the audiographic essays.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Critical Audiography: Lessons of a “Stereophonic” Approach</strong>   </p>\n<p>About twelve miles West of Charing Cross station, in the London borough of Hillingdon, lies the town of Hayes. If you were visiting there in the winter of 2018, you would have found a large construction site just steps from the light rail station, part of a £250 million redevelopment with high rises and midrise towers that will include 642 homes, a cinema and a performance venue. It’s called the Old Vinyl Factory, for good reason. In the 20<sup>th</sup> century the recording giant EMI had a factory here, where they pressed and packaged famous records by the Beatles and Pink Floyd. Today, developers are milking this heritage for all it’s worth. On the wall of a lounge on the first floor of one set of flats blazes an orange neon sign reading “Record Store,” although no dusty albums are for sale. Between buildings sit concrete benches shaped like record players, with stylized steel tonearms as elbow rests. A stretched-fabric mural covers a car park with images of screaming teenage Beatles fans, while iconic Brit rock lines are painted across low walls (“Put on your red shoes and dance the blues” “There’s nothing you can do that can’t be done”). And there in the center of it all is a two-story sculpture harkening back to an even earlier era, one that any sound studies scholar or music buff would know instantly: Nipper, the charming terrier from Francis Barraud’s 1899 <em>His Master’s Voice</em> logo used by Victor Records and the Gramophone Company Ltd in the U.K., an early global icon of music on disc.</p>\n<p>It is striking that, like many modern homages to the famous image, the sculpture bungles the whole idea. Because there is no Victrola horn into which Nipper’s quizzical gaze and billowing ears are directed – no source of the “master’s voice” in <em>His Master’s Voice</em> – the miracle promised by recording technology is lost. This is supposed to be a dog communing with its lost owner whose voice has been preserved on a cylinder or disc, a terrier testifying to the fidelity of mechanized sound by performing fidelity to his master. But the device emblematizing that preservation is nowhere to be seen (at least, nothing had been put in place as of 2018). In trying to honor the legacy of 20<sup>th</sup> century musical recording technology (or to squeeze out any nostalgia left for it), the sculpture only depicts its absence. At the Old Vinyl Factory lofts, faithful old Nipper is listening to something that isn’t there.  </p>\n<p>Thinking about sonic absences – specifically about listening for forms that should be there but aren’t  – captures something we experienced as we developed this special double issue of <em>[in]Transition </em>focusing on academic thought that takes the form of digital sound. In 2017 the editors of this publication generously offered us the incredible opportunity to use this unique platform to bring focus to emerging digital practices that are a sonic corollary of videography, and that we are calling “audiography”: a form that leverages digital technology to use the very materials of audio media in order to present research <em>about</em> audio media. The desire to explore the audiographic as an expressive mode seemed inevitable, in part thanks to the rise of podcasts in academic settings, both in and out of the classroom, where many professors and creators are no longer satisfied with using digital recording for mere lecture capture, and instead wish to incorporate its emerging social forms and technological affordances into the shape of their argumentation. Indeed, audiography has already taken hold, with podcasts like SCMS’s <a href=\"http://www.aca-media.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Aca-Media</em></a>, Stanford’s <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/state-of-the-human/id518898586\" target=\"_blank\"><em>State of the Human</em></a>, Mack Hagood’s <a href=\"http://phantompod.org/about-us-2/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Phantom Power</em></a> and Lance Dann and Martin Spinelli’s <a href=\"https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/for-your-ears-only-martin-spinelli-and-A2ilweVf0yj/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>For Your Ears Only</em></a>, as well as shows from the nonacademic world that explore a range of sound phenomena, such as <a href=\"https://www.20k.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Twenty Thousand Hertz</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.radiodramarevival.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Radio Drama Revival</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.youmustrememberthispodcast.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>You Must Remember This</em></a> and <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/masterclass_podcast\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Masterclass</em></a>. If podcasts such as those represent “audio” art moving into the space of “graphic” textuality, online textual forms are increasingly importing linked or even embedded audio to help make arguments. Examples include <a href=\"https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/558606/558607\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Journal of Sonic Studies</em></a>, <a href=\"https://ro.uow.edu.au/rdr/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>RadioDoc Review</em></a>, and especially <a href=\"https://soundstudiesblog.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Sounding Out!</em></a><em>,</em> which for a decade has been a pioneer of “doing” sound studies through the integration of sonic elements that help explore the relationship between sound and social difference.  </p>\n<p>There are antecedents to this kind of work. One need only look to the practices of acoustic ecologists, field recordists, sound artists and deep listening practitioners (we are thinking here of Annea Lockwood, Hildegard Westerkamp, Mendi + Keith Obadike or Pauline Oliveros), and radio feature-making and sound documentary (the work of Alan Hall, Joe Richman and Cathy FitzGerald, for instance) to see clear elements of a sharp critical sensibility embedded in formal practices oriented to audiences beyond the walls of the academy. A quirky antecedent from the domain of media studies can be found in Marshall McLuhan’s Columbia LP “The Medium is the Massage” (1968), which attempts to use sound effects, music, and multiple speakers to convey the texture of contemporary media culture. A more contemporary effort that resonates with many works in this issue is the <a href=\"https://citiesandmemory.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Cities and Memory</u></a> project, which since 2014 has mapped thousands of sounds from 80 countries around the world along with “reimaginings” of each recording, pieces that often land somewhere between art and theory. In our own program in Sound Arts and Industries at Northwestern we encourage students to communicate sound studies and sound science using sound media, and our regional organization the Great Lakes Association for Sound Studies (GLASS) includes critical soundwalks and experimental recording as part of its ambit. Jacob Smith’s recent project <em>ESC: Sonic Adventure in the Anthropocene</em> (University of Michigan Press, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.10120795\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.10120795</a>), uses audio as the medium for an eco-critical analysis of the CBS Radio adventure series <em>Escape</em> (1947–54), and demonstrates that a place exists for audiographic criticism in the domain of academic publication.</p>\n<p>Yet even in all these current examples and antecedents, there seemed no universal model of what audiographic work might sound like, no recipe or set of parameters about what to record, how to record it, how to mix it and present it, how to legitimize it and cite it, how to integrate sound tracks with text, the degree of scholarly apparatus to import – to name just a few thorny methodological, theoretical and technical problems the audiographer faces and that set her apart from other kinds of academic creators. Our thought was that an open call process might yield such a model, and that this platform could play a crucial role in enshrining it. After all, as its mission statement explains, <em>[in]Transition </em>is a platform not only to present work, but to give it disciplinary validation to “create a context for understanding” a form. Like Nipper in Barraud’s painting, we had the opportunity to listen to, and potentially legitimize an innovation, to “recognize” it on behalf of the disciplines of sound and media studies.</p>\n<p>In the end, however, it turned out we were more like the Nipper at the Old Vinyl Factory site than the Nipper on the classic logo, in that our attention focused less on a unified object, and more on a suggestive absence. Despite our intention to locate a singular blueprint for audiographic work, we found that no single submission we received felt like its shape and method could be exportable to the circumstances of one of the others, and that there was therefore no concrete formula before us. This was a blessing in disguise. In this issue, you will find a stunning variety of contexts, materials and engagements, testifying to the breadth and ambition of sound studies today. Our audiographers used sound as an entry way to fresh explorations of feminist <em>avant garde</em> artwork, themes of refugee experience and of nomadism, textures of vernacular experience ranging from teenage videos to spaces of elegiac memory, remediations from cinema to podcasting, issues of preservation, and sonic activism in the wake of recent travel bans. In contexts from Ohio to Vienna, from Syria to Bangalore, our authors cover topics including migrant experiences of “orientation,” ciné-mix cultural habits as an expression of a viewing itinerary, haptic aesthetics in women’s vocal performance, podcast archiving, and communion with postmemorial ghosts.</p>\n<p>While there may not have been a dominant defining mode to the contributions in this special issue, we heard some important themes emerging as it took shape. As Jonathan Sterne has observed, the capacious curiosity of sound students is often met by an equally energized self-awareness of their own positional partiality (Sterne 2012, 4). In this case, while our group of audiographers have wide-ranging interests and disciplinary affiliations, they share an awareness that their academic work is “positioned” by attending media forms. As our responses point out in the articles that follow, each author seems to have selected one or two sonorous forms as an “other” that their argumentative and expressive intervention emulates, draws upon or stands in tension with. Thus audiographies in this issue reflect and inflect sonic forms we already recognize, including academic talks, DVD commentaries, radio documentaries, audiobooks, radio interviews, sound installations, fandubs and more. If we are looking for a single, common form of the audiography itself, we may be out of luck on this outing. Other than taking the form of an audio track supported by a textual statement, these pieces have little in common thematically. But they do share a gesture: each one reaches from an established expressive audio form toward a mode of scholarly critical engagement, or reaches from an established mode of scholarly engagement toward an established expressive audio form. In this way, audiographers trace a line across a gulf, but they do so in a way that need not blaze a permanent path. In negotiating the space between scholarly practice and the audio arts, audiographers create overlaps that are curiously unexpected, impermanent, and ad hoc. For this reason, we view the submissions in this issue as lessons in how, within the context of a particular political or intellectual project, a creator can negotiate between what it takes to make sound work and what it takes to make sound think. </p>\n<p>Audiography as we understand it means using recording and mixing as <em>intellectual</em> tools, as essential components in the act of making an academic argument with the audio form in mind; as opposed to using sound as an afterthought. Audiography negotiates making sound work and making sound think, and so links an evolving scholarly discourse with an evolving genre of audio. To capture this interwoven “two-channel\" aspect of audiography we might consider another part of the history of the EMI factory in West London. A generation before The Beatles and a generation after the Nipper painting, the Hayes site was not just a working factory but also a laboratory, one of the key sites (along with Bell Labs) in which concepts and models for stereophonic sound were developed. Legendary engineer Alan Blumlein worked on this site when EMI was formed in 1931, the same year he filed his famous patent 394, 325, which defined some 70 separate processes, materials, and methods for how to record and transduce two-channel stereo recordings. In fact, the train you take to get to the Old Vinyl Factory lofts runs along the same line on which Blumlein and his team recorded one of the <a href=\"https://www.emiarchivetrust.org/trains-at-hayes-the-worlds-first-stereo-film-made-in-1935-clip/\" target=\"_blank\">earliest stereophonic films</a>.  Of course, experiments in binaural and stereophonic sound had been around for more than a century by then, deriving their logic from what Théberge, Divine and Everett call the historical rise of the spatialized acoustic subject (See Théberge, Divine and Everett 2015). In the 1930s, stereo was still ahead of its time as a commercial matter – most of Blumlein’s techniques were unused until after the patent expired in 1952 and stereo returned as a music technique in the late 1950s (Anderson 2006; Schmidt Horning 2015). Among Blumlein’s key insights in this lineage was to work out the mathematics that converts the <em>phase difference</em> of a sound that hits two recording sources at the same time into an <em>amplitude difference</em>, which gives many listeners the illusion of dimensionality (Burns 2000). This was one of several techniques EMI labs devised that allowed for creating a stereo spread that could be produced using only two loudspeakers, without resulting in the “hole in the middle” that had bedeviled previous systems.</p>\n<p>Much has been written about the way two-channel stereo rationalizes a certain relation to the world through the construction of “sweet spots” for listening along with new aesthetics for “realism” and gendered hierarchies of experience in it (see Grajeda 2015; Keightley 1996). The recording process that creates that effect remains grounded in concepts developed at Hayes and places like it in the mid 20<sup>th</sup> century, but today it can be achieved through a range of configurations: using two omnidirectional mics spaced from one another; two cardioid microphones placed at 90-degree angles one atop the another; dummy head configurations, that create a dead zone where the flesh and skull of a listener might be, producing “3-D” audio; and more recent ambisonic technologies designed to push beyond stereophonic applications and into VR (see Virostek 2013, 189-96). However they are configured, though, the idea of stereophonic representation is rooted in the material fact of two slightly different perceptions occurring at once, captured at a common rate, across a small but perceptually significant gulf of space or time. The stereo recordist’s art is to find a way to stitch those two nearly identical experiences together into a form that resolves them, an artificial and temporary unity of perception.</p>\n<p>This, we wish to submit, is an apt metaphor for the dilemma of the audiographer, and one that each creator in this issue resolves in their own way. On the one side, there is scholarship, and all the propositional and non-propositional ways that academics go about producing, processing, disrupting, circulating and storing knowledge. On the other side are a myriad of expressive sound forms – from audiobooks to seances, podcasts to field recordings – that give the audiographer a form to work in, and a potential listening public to reach. Audiography, for us, is what happens when these two resonating entities overlap and create a temporary illusion of a center derived from the margins. We said above that this special issue doesn’t have a hard and fast <em>model</em> for potential audiographers, but it does have a series of <em>lessons</em> in the way each creator uses her unique position between a discourse and an expressive form to create her own sweet spot based on material and method. In aggregate, these works also have a philosophy, one we might liken to post-Blumlein stereophonic practices: it is <em>by virtue of</em> an absent center to the genre – and not in spite of it – that critical audiographic logics may emerge.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Works Cited</strong></p>\n<p>Anderson, Tim. 2006. <em>Making Easy Listening: Material Culture and Postwar American Recording</em>.

      "body": "<p>As a work of audiography, Pond’s three sonic collages show how field recording can serve as the scaffolding for making critical arguments in sound. Consider the way different mixing strategies create emphases between the three pieces. In the trucker chapel recording, we move from a trucker talking about working more and earning less, to the cab of a truck from which the voice of Donald Trump promises an America that will “boom again,” to the quiet intimacy of the mobile chapel, with songs and spiritual healing. This pattern powerfully inflects our listening by movement from one place to the next in a concatenated but obviously assembled sequence of fragments that has the effect of essayistic montage. The second piece emphasizes layering rather than sequencing, with sounds overlain atop one another rather than spatialized; this tends to de-emphasize what is left out in between the gaps of the recording, offering a set of painterly washes at the Orthodox supper. Finally, the protest piece emphasizes continuity of time, like a long take. It has a multiplying quality, using repetition and echoic effects to make slogans into bold placards of sound that break across the stereo image like waves. Sequencing, layering and continuity are three distinct strategies, and to get a sense of their structuring force, we need only imagine what one of the three elements might have sounded like in using the mixing strategy of another.</p>\n<p>We can also think across the three pieces as an assemblage with an overall aesthetic. As a whole they make an implicit comparison of the relationships that are possible between voices and spaces. As Silverstein points out in her essay, we notice a contrast in the “dryness” and “wetness” of the various reverberance of these scenes. Pond thus shows us how audiography could advance studies of the acoustic spaces of religious practice (see Charles Hirschkind’s <em>The Ethical Soundscape</em>, Patrick Eisenlohr’s <em>Sounding Islam</em>, and Richard Cullen Rath’s chapter on Quaker meeting halls in <em>How Early America Sounded</em>), through concrete choices of recording, composition and curation.</p>\n<p><strong>Works Cited</strong></p>\n<p>Eisenlohr, Patrick. 2018. <em>Sounding Islam: Voice, Media, and Sonic Atmospheres in an Indian Ocean World</em>.

      "body": "<p>“But what of the ethnographic ear?” famously asked James Clifford in his seminal critique of the poetics and politics of ethnography (Clifford 1986, 12). His question resonated deeply during a sensory turn in anthropology in which ethnographers’ attention shifted “from sight and vision to sound and voice, from text to performance, from monologue to dialogue” (Conquergood 1991, 183). This audiography, by Lauren Pond with the American Religious Sounds Project, follows in the footsteps of these dialogues that center aurality as a site of ethnographic encounter. Hers is a strikingly intimate work that archives religious pluralism through field recordings of America’s heartland.</p>\n<p>Across three audio collages, Pond approaches her recordings with a preservationist spirit that draws on radio documentary practices. The first segment narrativizes a quest for evangelical redemption among truckers at the Truckers for Christ mobile chapel in Lodi, Ohio. Pond juxtaposes ambient mechanical noise with the relative calm within the chapel (a converted semi-tractor trailer) to convey how religious solace is demanded by transient lives spent on the road. By presenting the chapel as acoustically dry, Pond arguably renders acoustic Emily Thompson’s argument that a “lack of reverberation” has historically marked certain spaces as “modern” (Thompson 2004).</p>\n<p>In contrast to the dry sonic signature of the trucker chapel, the second track shifts to an excessively wet rendering of a local gathering of members of the St. Stevan of Dechani Serbian Orthodox Church in Columbus, Ohio. Wetness saturates each segment of this audio collage, from the chatter of voices in a highly reflective room to the transductive sounds of water boiling and fish frying as church members prepare a meal for Lent. Whether linguistic or environmental, these reverberant sounds portray Serbian Orthodox gatherings as highly communal in ways that arguably delimit such socio-religious spaces as more traditional than modern.</p>\n<p>The work concludes with an audio collage set in the political present, specifically 2017 protests over Trump Administration travel bans that target Muslim-majority countries. Pond authenticates these public assemblies as markers of Muslim-American life by foregrounding vocal remarks of protesters who self-identify as Muslim. As collective protest chants ricochet off the concrete surfaces of the Columbus airport, a Doppler effect acts as a sonic metaphor for how the political vulnerability of Muslim subjects extends beyond individuals directly impacted by the ban to affect, and ally, a national polity. Yet this setting made me question whether the precarity of Muslim rights speaks for the entirety of Muslim-American lived experience, or whether this focus implicitly recognizes Muslims through the Orientalist gaze rather than on their own terms, a representational tactic that the other audioworlds successfully avoid.</p>\n<p>Together, these audio collages compose distinct religious and cultural worlds through the use of acoustic texture and sonic metaphor. Pond clearly attributes agency to her ethnographic subjects and privileges the meaning-making processes of religious culture. However, Pond and her collaborators might benefit from extending their work to include their own presence and active participation, what Tim Ingold calls “zones of entanglement” (Ingold 2008). Integrating dialogic relations within the collages themselves could potentially redistribute the authorial control currently structuring this work, such that “vulnerability and self-disclosure [become] enabled through conversation” (Conquergood 1991, 183). Nonetheless there is much to be gained through this work. By amplifying religious pluralism through audio collage, Pond offers a set of echoes through which, as Steven Feld suggests, listeners become entangled “with reverberant pasts in the present, presents in the past” (Feld 1994: 5). Her work raises compelling questions about how we might listen for religion, and how seeking such through its sonic manifestations offers new perspectives on the makings of religious life in our contemporary America.</p>\n<p><strong>Works Cited</strong></p>\n<p>Clifford, James, and George E.
