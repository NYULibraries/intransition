  "body": "<p>I remember when my mum first invited me to watch <em>Hannibal</em> with her – yes, she was introduced to it earlier than I was. She tried to lure me into watching it by saying it’s very artistic because it uses a lot of detailed shots. Although I was a little bit sceptical at first, ‘close-up,’ in the end, truly is one of the first words that comes to my mind when I think of my intense experience watching the series. </p>\n<p>While browsing dictionaries for the definitions of close-up to use in my video essay, I realized that the examples of the word as used in a sentence much more accurately reflected my experience of digesting <em>Hannibal</em> (pun intended). Juxtaposing the seemingly-innocent sentences with the horror, cruelty and gore in the images not only creates a new meaning for them but can also serve as a coping mechanism.</p>\n<p>As the extreme close-ups become just abstract lines, their meaning is suspended, at least for a moment, until the camera zooms out enough for us to identify the objects we’re looking at. One of the examples used in the video – “They are particularly striking closeup but can look indistinct from a distance” – pitches out the exact opposite in <em>Hannibal</em>. It is actually the close-ups that are indistinct and more bearable to watch; and it is the context revealed that makes our body shiver. The time-limited comfort can be found in ascribing new meanings to the unidentifiable images. Therefore, placing the sentences from the dictionary over the images from <em>Hannibal</em> not only represents the horror of realizing the context; it also reflects on the process of trying to find other possible meanings for the images, or alternative contexts, until the moment of realization.</p>\n<p>Where Lori Morimoto starts her video essay “Hannibal: a fanvid” with the word “intimacy,” the word for my own video would be “distance,” suggesting another way of reception of the close-up shots in <em>Hannibal</em>. Personally, as a huge fan, I feel like first I had to establish a coping mechanism, a safety net in order to be able to engulf myself fully in the emotional intimacy of the series – and the abstract details helped me establish that distance, at least for short spans of time. Thus, close-up shots are one of the many ambiguities of <em>Hannibal</em>.      </p>\n<p><strong>Works cited:</strong></p>\n<p>Morimoto, L. (2016).

She is interested in cross-disciplinary topics from both sociological and film/media theories, but mainly queer theories. She is currently working on her bachelor’s thesis, which analyses the TV series <em>Hannibal</em> through queer masochistic theories and masochistic aesthetics.</p>\n",

      "body": "<p><strong>Special Pedagogy Issue: The TV Dictionary </strong></p>\n<p><em>Guest Editor's Introduction by Ariel Avissar</em></p>\n<p>This is the second of two special issues devoted to videographic pedagogy, highlighting student work. <a href=\"https://mediacommons.org/intransition/journal-videographic-film-moving-image-studies-104a-2023\">The first issue</a> showcased videos made by my own students in response to existing video essays; this issue presents and reflects on a curated selection of videos made by various students as part of the “<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/showcase/8660446/video/796127893\">TV Dictionary</a>,” a collaborative videographic project devoted to television. The project is premised on a simple prompt: each video attempts to capture the essence of a particular television series using a single word, by juxtaposing the dictionary definition(s) of that word with a clip or several clips from the series. I started it in July of 2021, and invited others to join in – which they did in spades; as of December 2023, 112 videos have been made by 50 makers worldwide; the collection as a whole or individual entries have received numerous mentions on <em>Sight &amp; Sound</em>’s best video essays polls for 2021 and 2022, and many others have expressed an interest in making their own entries, or in applying the prompt as part of their teaching.</p>\n<p>I believe at least part of the appeal of this parameter-based prompt, in the context of videographic TV studies, is in the (relatively) narrow focus dictated by the selection of a single word (and in many cases,  a single clip as well) – a welcome focus, as the long-form serial nature of television texts and the at times immense amount of raw material available can make videographic engagement seem daunting to begin with (for both the scholar and their editing platform). The project thus holds interest for scholars of television, videographic and otherwise, as an example of “<a href=\"http://mediacommons.org/intransition/2017/videographic-telephilia\">videographic telephilia</a>” that offers a productive range of avenues of engagement with televisual texts.</p>\n<p>While the prompt itself is quite simple, the various videos in the collection have responded to it in very different ways, applying a diverse range of formal and stylistic choices, at times sombre, at times playful; at times adopting the tone and language of the chosen series, at times deconstructing or subverting them. Some of the contributors are well-established videographic practitioners, who welcomed the opportunity to apply this new perspective on their own objects of research and fandom, in some cases incorporating their entries as part of their broader videographic and theoretical projects; for others, scholars and fans of television, this was a first dabble in videographic criticism, one that will hopefully lead to further experimentation with the form.</p>\n<p>In 2022, I sent out a special call for entries, inviting student contributions to the TV Dictionary. Out of the numerous student submissions made in response to the call, this issue presents a curation of seven videos that I felt made the best use of the premise of the project, and that opened new ways of looking at the material and of contextualizing it within broader frames of reference. This diverse offering represents, in my opinion, some of the best, most thoughtful, and most inventive work in the TV Dictionary as a whole. Each student’s work is presented alongside another entry from the collection, with which it shares certain formal, thematic, or generic characteristics. The pieces are also accompanied by creators’ statements by the student makers, and written reflections by the makers of the accompanying videos, reflecting on the students’ pieces and on their relation to their own. I hope this selection of videos and written reflections will serve to highlight the pedagogical potential of the TV Dictionary project, and will perhaps inspire other teachers to use it in class, and other students and makers to contribute to this ongoing endeavour.</p>\n"

      "body": "<p>If I had to sum up Karin Spišáková’s entry on <em>Hannibal</em> in a word, which word would I choose?</p>\n<p>My first thought is of “defamiliarization.” <em>Merriam-Webster's Dictionary</em> defines “defamiliarize” as “to present or render in an unfamiliar artistic form usually to stimulate fresh perception.” Indeed, the close-up shot can do just that, as many have discussed since the early days of cinema, from Walter Benjamin to Mary Ann Doane. But, taking a lead from Spišáková, perhaps more interesting than the dictionary definition of “defamiliarization” is this example listed underneath it, which could easily apply to the clips featured in the video: “And these fragments, when examined closely, <em>defamiliarize</em> ordinary […] reality in a manner different from that of hypnagogia.” The images featured in the video not only defamiliarize the objects they display in extreme close-up, but are themselves defamiliarized by Spišáková’s edit, which removes them from their original narrative context, enabling their examination and aesthetic appreciation alongside formally-similar images. This act of defamiliarization in fact characterizes much of videographic criticism. And, of course, a defamiliarization of sorts is also enacted here on the format of the TV Dictionary itself, with the inspired choice of focusing on example sentences rather than word definitions. This highlights the contextual nature of language, including audiovisual language, as Spišáková reflects in her creator’s statement.</p>\n<p>Her entry relates to my own (much simpler and more “traditional”) entry on <em>Dexter</em> in several ways: both series focus on serial killers, of course; both play with subjective perspectives, at times focalizing the narrative through abnormal, traumatized or pathological subjectivities outside “normal” society – another form of defamiliarization of the “regular.” In <em>Dexter</em>’s case, this is particularly evident in the opening credits sequence, which renders the familiar and mundane – an ordinary morning routine – strange and sinister. Both entries have chosen to focus on highly-stylized sequences that make much use of extreme close-up shots, though in <em>Dexter</em>’s case this is the exception to the rule, whereas <em>Hannibal</em> deploys such aesthetic defamiliarization more freely.</p>\n<p>But while “defamiliarization” certainly provides some insight into the video, I find myself drawn to that final word in the sentence quoted above: “hypnagogia.” I will admit I had to look that one up! <em>Merriam-Webster</em> defines “hypnagogic” as “of, relating to, or occurring in the period of drowsiness immediately preceding sleep.” Once again, underneath this definition can be found a relevant sentence: “The hypnagogic state is that heady lull between wakefulness and sleep when thoughts and images flutter, melt, and transform into wild things.” Perhaps “hypnagogia,” then, would be the word I would choose to capture the essence of Spišáková’s entry, in which thoughts, images, and words indeed flutter, melt, and transform into wild things.</p>\n"
