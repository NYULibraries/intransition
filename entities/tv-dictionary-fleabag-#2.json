  "body": "<p>In my mind, the feeling of “revelation” is like floating away on the ocean. You enjoy the sun, the waves, the beauty that surrounds you… when suddenly, the beach is nowhere to be seen. But then, just as you wonder how you got here, an island reveals itself: great, full of mystery and possibilities, pleasurable and painful alike. It sheds a different light on all the seemingly meaningless experiences that led you there, turning each wave into a step towards this newly-discovered goal.</p>\n<p>This feeling, of being led to an emotional-intellectual climax through light-hearted yet profound observation, is what I felt when watching the TV Dictionary entries and what also immediately brought <em>Fleabag</em> to mind. Fleabag’s emotional journey over both seasons is comprised of many tiny self-discoveries and revelations experienced by herself (as a character) and by the audience.</p>\n<p>Beyond this, working on the video held many other revelations in store for me to come across. I found that the TV Dictionary format allowed me to take a playful yet highly thematically-attuned approach to the material, each dictionary definition of “revelation”/”to reveal” uncovering additional thematic layers. Suddenly, I had a clear way of stating the previously unspoken or undefined. I hope this feeling comes across to the viewers as well, and that it creates an experience where, just like in <em>Fleabag</em>, the profound emotional sum is greater than its fun and light-hearted parts.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Biography:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sharon Abramovich</strong> is a Ukrainian living in southern Israel, and an undergraduate at the Steve Tisch School of Film and Television, Tel Aviv University.

      "body": "<p><strong>Special Pedagogy Issue: The TV Dictionary </strong></p>\n<p><em>Guest Editor's Introduction by Ariel Avissar</em></p>\n<p>This is the second of two special issues devoted to videographic pedagogy, highlighting student work. <a href=\"https://mediacommons.org/intransition/journal-videographic-film-moving-image-studies-104a-2023\">The first issue</a> showcased videos made by my own students in response to existing video essays; this issue presents and reflects on a curated selection of videos made by various students as part of the “<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/showcase/8660446/video/796127893\">TV Dictionary</a>,” a collaborative videographic project devoted to television. The project is premised on a simple prompt: each video attempts to capture the essence of a particular television series using a single word, by juxtaposing the dictionary definition(s) of that word with a clip or several clips from the series. I started it in July of 2021, and invited others to join in – which they did in spades; as of December 2023, 112 videos have been made by 50 makers worldwide; the collection as a whole or individual entries have received numerous mentions on <em>Sight &amp; Sound</em>’s best video essays polls for 2021 and 2022, and many others have expressed an interest in making their own entries, or in applying the prompt as part of their teaching.</p>\n<p>I believe at least part of the appeal of this parameter-based prompt, in the context of videographic TV studies, is in the (relatively) narrow focus dictated by the selection of a single word (and in many cases,  a single clip as well) – a welcome focus, as the long-form serial nature of television texts and the at times immense amount of raw material available can make videographic engagement seem daunting to begin with (for both the scholar and their editing platform). The project thus holds interest for scholars of television, videographic and otherwise, as an example of “<a href=\"http://mediacommons.org/intransition/2017/videographic-telephilia\">videographic telephilia</a>” that offers a productive range of avenues of engagement with televisual texts.</p>\n<p>While the prompt itself is quite simple, the various videos in the collection have responded to it in very different ways, applying a diverse range of formal and stylistic choices, at times sombre, at times playful; at times adopting the tone and language of the chosen series, at times deconstructing or subverting them. Some of the contributors are well-established videographic practitioners, who welcomed the opportunity to apply this new perspective on their own objects of research and fandom, in some cases incorporating their entries as part of their broader videographic and theoretical projects; for others, scholars and fans of television, this was a first dabble in videographic criticism, one that will hopefully lead to further experimentation with the form.</p>\n<p>In 2022, I sent out a special call for entries, inviting student contributions to the TV Dictionary. Out of the numerous student submissions made in response to the call, this issue presents a curation of seven videos that I felt made the best use of the premise of the project, and that opened new ways of looking at the material and of contextualizing it within broader frames of reference. This diverse offering represents, in my opinion, some of the best, most thoughtful, and most inventive work in the TV Dictionary as a whole. Each student’s work is presented alongside another entry from the collection, with which it shares certain formal, thematic, or generic characteristics. The pieces are also accompanied by creators’ statements by the student makers, and written reflections by the makers of the accompanying videos, reflecting on the students’ pieces and on their relation to their own. I hope this selection of videos and written reflections will serve to highlight the pedagogical potential of the TV Dictionary project, and will perhaps inspire other teachers to use it in class, and other students and makers to contribute to this ongoing endeavour.</p>\n"

      "body": "<p>Sharon Abramovich’s and my own entries on <em>Fleabag </em>share an interest in and meta-performance of the show’s outstanding rhythm—in both comedic and stylistic terms. This is a rhythm that of course strongly correlates with the protagonist’s inner drive and the complex, “polyphonic” family relationships with which she is faced, particularly in the second season. In my own reflection on the <em>CST Online Blog</em>’s series on the TV Dictionary, I stated that <em>Fleabag </em>is essentially a show about restlessness—a restlessness that is based on grief, guilt, and longing and that provokes her to both run away from and run towards the issues and people who have caused her pain.[1] The latter point, our heroine’s ability and fearlessness to confront and break through the polite silence of her family and the society around her (most brilliantly explored in the family dinner scene, from which Abramovich takes multiple clips), is at the core of this video’s take on the show.</p>\n<p>Through the term “revelation” and through a seeming outward focus on the religious themes in the show’s second season, above all the central relationship with the priest, Abramovich dives deeply into <em>Fleabag</em>’s confrontational journey—a journey which begins with her non-religiously-motivated oath of celibacy in the beginning of season two and which ends with her peaceful departure from the show and from her semi-diegetic audience (us), with which she communicated throughout the show. The video maker cleverly plays with the placement of text on screen to allude to and explore the religious and iconographic intricacies and jokes in <em>Fleabag</em>’s church scenes, as well as the family dinner scene, which arguably serves as a “last supper” within the aesthetic of the show. In this, it speaks to the particular creative, epigraphic impetus behind the TV Dictionary prompt.</p>\n<p>[1] Evelyn Kreutzer, \"TV Dictionary - Binging/Watching/Making: Escapism in <em>Fleabag</em>, <em>Friends</em>, <em>Stranger Things</em>, and <em>Yellowjackets</em>.\" <em>Critical Studies in Television Online Blog</em>. <a href=\"https://cstonline.net/tv-dictionary-binging-watching-making-escapism-in-fleabag-friends-stranger-things-and-yellowjackets-by-evelyn-kreutzer/?fbclid=IwAR0I38Iw1tzSwmLK5CrHkN-etDkatdGUVDdRMpy4nB7j_u3xNOtQJRbIRoc\">https://cstonline.net/tv-dictionary-binging-watching-making-escapism-in-fleabag-friends-stranger-things-and-yellowjackets-by-evelyn-kreutzer/?fbclid=IwAR0I38Iw1tzSwmLK5CrHkN-etDkatdGUVDdRMpy4nB7j_u3xNOtQJRbIRoc</a>.
