A day we collaborated together at a video workshop as a part of whitechapelgallery.org/events/indefinite-visions/.</p>\n<p>The referendum was on our mind. Officially, it was not on the mind of the British media since the day was a \"blackout period\" as far as coverage of the referendum was concerned. We wondered what images and sounds were finding their way into the (un)consciousness of the British voting public. This compilation of memories from the campaign and more nostalgic, personal recollection is the result.</p>",
