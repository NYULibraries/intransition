A day we collaborated together at a video workshop as a part of whitechapelgallery.org/events/indefinite-visions/.</p>\n<p>The referendum was on our mind. Officially, it was not on the mind of the British media since the day was a \"blackout period\" as far as coverage of the referendum was concerned. We wondered what images and sounds were finding their way into the (un)consciousness of the British voting public. This compilation of memories from the campaign and more nostalgic, personal recollection is the result.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The editors of <strong><em>[in]Transition</em></strong> are pleased to present this double issue -- a specially curated dossier of videographic work produced by participants in the Indefinite Visions conference and workshop, orgainzed by Richard Misek and held in June 2016 at the Whitechapel Gallery, London. This event brought together experienced videographic producers and first-time makers in a wonderful spirit of collaboration and innovation. We are proud to have the opportunity to showcase the resulting work -- most of it produced in a very short period of time and in less than perfect circumstances -- which is wide-ranging in approach and bristling with imagination and ideas.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/intransition/2017/05/31/indefinite-visions-introduction\">Richard Misek's introduction</a> provides a useful overview of the project; the videos span across this page and the <a href=\"http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/intransition/theme-week/2017/22/journal-videographic-film-moving-image-studies-42b-2017\">second installment of the issue</a>.</p>"
