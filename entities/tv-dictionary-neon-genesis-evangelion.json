  "body": "<p>Beneath the cryptic religious symbolism, unexplained sci-fi jargon, and abstract interior monologues, my reading of <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion </em>(1995)<em> </em>has always been simple: <em>Evangelion</em> is the story of a boy realizing what it means to connect with the people around him. Thus, for my entry into the TV Dictionary, I paired “realize” with <em>Evangelion</em> due to the thematic congruence between the two. </p>\n<p>The structuring of my video was a process of subtraction. After a broader first draft that attempted to use every definition of “realize” I could find, I restricted my essay into focusing only on the final two episodes of <em>Evangelion</em>, in which the protagonist goes on an interior journey of self-discovery through his subconscious. These episodes are rich in abstract imagery, and the sort of commentaries on selfhood, connection, identity, and semiotics that led me to choose “realize” as my word in the first place. I attempted to create an arc throughout the essay that traces the protagonist’s journey of self-realization through the different definitions of “realize.”</p>\n<p>The constraints of the TV Dictionary project provided a fulfilling challenge for me. As someone who has traditionally worked with extensive voice-over narration in my videographic work, being forced to work only through juxtaposition gave me a new appreciation for the power of the image and comparison. Not having to worry about voice-over also meant I was able to pour more attention into presentation: I had a great deal of fun styling my on-screen titles after the iconic title cards present in <em>Evangelion</em>, and trying to evoke a feeling of the 1990s, memory, and nostalgia through VHS filters over the text. </p>\n<p>In all, I’ve learned a great deal through participating in the TV Dictionary that I will certainly carry into my future projects. I hope that my work can offer a new, or at least streamlined, perspective on <em>Evangelion</em> as a story about how we express ourselves and our identity, interpersonal connection, and the simple yet profound realization that we must take care of ourselves.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Biography:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>James DeLisio</strong> is a filmmaker and undergraduate student at the University of California, San Diego.

      "body": "<p><strong>Special Pedagogy Issue: The TV Dictionary </strong></p>\n<p><em>Guest Editor's Introduction by Ariel Avissar</em></p>\n<p>This is the second of two special issues devoted to videographic pedagogy, highlighting student work. <a href=\"https://mediacommons.org/intransition/journal-videographic-film-moving-image-studies-104a-2023\">The first issue</a> showcased videos made by my own students in response to existing video essays; this issue presents and reflects on a curated selection of videos made by various students as part of the “<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/showcase/8660446/video/796127893\">TV Dictionary</a>,” a collaborative videographic project devoted to television. The project is premised on a simple prompt: each video attempts to capture the essence of a particular television series using a single word, by juxtaposing the dictionary definition(s) of that word with a clip or several clips from the series. I started it in July of 2021, and invited others to join in – which they did in spades; as of December 2023, 112 videos have been made by 50 makers worldwide; the collection as a whole or individual entries have received numerous mentions on <em>Sight &amp; Sound</em>’s best video essays polls for 2021 and 2022, and many others have expressed an interest in making their own entries, or in applying the prompt as part of their teaching.</p>\n<p>I believe at least part of the appeal of this parameter-based prompt, in the context of videographic TV studies, is in the (relatively) narrow focus dictated by the selection of a single word (and in many cases,  a single clip as well) – a welcome focus, as the long-form serial nature of television texts and the at times immense amount of raw material available can make videographic engagement seem daunting to begin with (for both the scholar and their editing platform). The project thus holds interest for scholars of television, videographic and otherwise, as an example of “<a href=\"http://mediacommons.org/intransition/2017/videographic-telephilia\">videographic telephilia</a>” that offers a productive range of avenues of engagement with televisual texts.</p>\n<p>While the prompt itself is quite simple, the various videos in the collection have responded to it in very different ways, applying a diverse range of formal and stylistic choices, at times sombre, at times playful; at times adopting the tone and language of the chosen series, at times deconstructing or subverting them. Some of the contributors are well-established videographic practitioners, who welcomed the opportunity to apply this new perspective on their own objects of research and fandom, in some cases incorporating their entries as part of their broader videographic and theoretical projects; for others, scholars and fans of television, this was a first dabble in videographic criticism, one that will hopefully lead to further experimentation with the form.</p>\n<p>In 2022, I sent out a special call for entries, inviting student contributions to the TV Dictionary. Out of the numerous student submissions made in response to the call, this issue presents a curation of seven videos that I felt made the best use of the premise of the project, and that opened new ways of looking at the material and of contextualizing it within broader frames of reference. This diverse offering represents, in my opinion, some of the best, most thoughtful, and most inventive work in the TV Dictionary as a whole. Each student’s work is presented alongside another entry from the collection, with which it shares certain formal, thematic, or generic characteristics. The pieces are also accompanied by creators’ statements by the student makers, and written reflections by the makers of the accompanying videos, reflecting on the students’ pieces and on their relation to their own. I hope this selection of videos and written reflections will serve to highlight the pedagogical potential of the TV Dictionary project, and will perhaps inspire other teachers to use it in class, and other students and makers to contribute to this ongoing endeavour.</p>\n"

      "body": "<p>This is an extremely thought-provoking contribution to the TV Dictionary, which suggests a meditation on pedagogy, childhood, and the role of <em>anime</em> within it. </p>\n<p>What stands out on first and repeated viewings is the arresting use of a slide projector sound effect to introduce intertitles which interrupt the clips from <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion.</em> This sudden eruption of an “old” technology disrupts the viewing experience with a discombobulating cognitive dissonance. The sound effect prompts expectation of a still image – there is even a momentary freezing of the moving image the first occasion it is used – but after the intertitle, as the slide projector sound effect continues to whir, comes another clip (a moving image). This disconcerting experience reminds the viewer of the coexistence of several recording formats (the written, the analogue, the digital) all in an instant. An almost instantaneous quasi-“flashback” emerges, down through the centuries to when scholars put pen to paper to define words and back again in a matter of seconds. This prompts various questions, most pertinently regarding how precisely we should understand the pedagogical nature of the video essay when it takes the form of a dictionary entry.</p>\n<p>The contrast between the projector sound effect and the moving images also indicates how challenging it is to capture, or to “realize,” the past via autobiographical memory. Beyond the pedagogical use of the projector, the sound effect also evokes the slideshow in the family home. As <em>Neon</em> is often watched by kids, the video essay prompts meditation on how to remember childhood:  whether in still or moving images, or in the more complex memories which children’s television provokes. To really “realize” the past, the video essay suggests, it may be necessary to rewatch, or even rework, a television show which shaped our childhood.</p>\n<p>The reflections which DeLisio’s video essay prompts indicate certain shared concerns with my own on <em>Battle of the Planets</em> (a US reworking of the Japanese <em>anime</em> <em>Kagaku Ninjatai Gatchaman</em>). Both video essays seek to expand the range of television examples in the TV Dictionary globally, and to experiment formally with the parameters of the audiovisual dictionary entry. As importantly, both engage with the intertwining of past and present to <em>inform</em> (in DeLisio’s video essay the sound of projector evoking its role as pedagogical tool), and to indicate the role of children’s television in autobiographical <em>memory</em> (the projector also reminiscent of family slideshows, so often projected in the same living room as the television).</p>\n"
