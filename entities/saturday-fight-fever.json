  "body": "<p>Watching Kevin B. Lee’s \"To The Lighthouse,\" we thought it was a very interesting (and fun!) experiment: by splicing together films featuring two of your favorite actors, you could create something completely new and unexpected! We were surprised by how “natural” some of the edits felt, as though Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson really were performing in front of one another throughout their filmography (and not only in <em>The Lighthouse</em>). We were also surprised by the new meanings produced through the juxtaposition of clips from totally unrelated films.</p>\n<p>Inspired, we decided to make a similar experiment of our own, and landed on John Travolta and Sylvester Stallone. Both actors are of Italian descent, and presented throughout their respective careers two very different types of masculinity, particularly from the late 60s to the early 80s. These representations defy expectations and are in dialogue with each other in surprising ways, as we discovered while working on this video.</p>\n<p>Since the subject of our video was masculinity, it was only natural to turn the encounter between these two film legends into a duel – after all, their most iconic films revolved around some type of competition, be it boxing or dancing. While their battles are different (a working title for the video essay was “Rocky Fights, Travolta Dances”) they share a ritualistic aspect; both actors (in multiple films) perform “rites of passage” in order to prove their masculinity.</p>\n<p>But Stallone and Travolta are not your typical hunks fighting to prove they are the best and nothing more; though they are undoubtedly celebrated icons of manhood, each of them expressed facets of masculinity that were mostly unexplored at the time. Travolta expressed different aspects of the male body – making skinny, elegant dancers the sexiest men in the world – and kept challenging masculinity later on in his career as well in humorous, self-aware, yet still critical ways, such as his hilarious role as Edna Turnblad in <em>Hairspray</em> (2007). And Stallone, though he’s all strength and muscle, showed that even strong men are capable of fragility, as illustrated in a scene from <em>First Blood</em> (1982), in which Rambo breaks down crying, incapable of leading a normal life due to his PTSD.</p>\n<p>While the subject-matter is serious, that doesn’t mean the form can’t be fun! Drawing inspiration from Stallone’s action movies and Travolta’s dance flicks, we made sure to piece the video together to a beat, maintaining a fast, rhythmic edit and an iconic soundtrack.</p>\n<p>Fun fact: Tony Manero, Travolta's character in <em>Saturday Night Fever</em> (1977), has a poster of Rocky Balboa hanging on his wall. <em>Staying Alive</em> (1983), the sequel to <em>Saturday Night Fever</em>, was directed by none other than Sylvester Stallone himself.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Biography:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Nitzan Kimel </strong>and <strong>Nadav Leshem </strong>are both undergraduate students at the Steve Tisch School of Film and Television, Tel Aviv University, studying in the school’s honors track.</p>\n",

      "body": "<p><strong>Special Pedagogy issue: Videographic Responses</strong></p>\n<p><em>Guest Editor's Introduction by Ariel Avissar</em></p>\n<p>This is the first of two special issues devoted to videographic pedagogy, highlighting student work. The current issue showcases and reflects on a selection of videos made by students of my own videographic criticism honors course at the Steve Tisch School of Film and Television at Tel Aviv University, between 2020 and 2022. One of the assignments I gave them was to respond videographically to an existing video essay of their choice, out of the numerous pieces highlighted in <em>Sight &amp; Sound</em>’s “best video essays” polls. Students were not given any further instructions on this assignment, and were free to respond in whichever way they saw fit to whichever video they felt a connection with.</p>\n<p>This assignment was met with enthusiasm, and the students went on to make dozens of response videos throughout each semester; it was a very effective way of getting them to discover new video essays, to reflect on their formal, structural and affective aspects and to devise diverse and original ways to respond to them: some chose to elaborate on the original video’s argument, others argued against it; some chose to enact experimentations designed to test the limits of the original video’s premise; and many chose to emulate the source videos, effectively “remaking” them, reverse-engineering their underlying functioning logic to extrapolate an algorithmic “script,” which could then be applied to alternative subject matters and media objects (a process which was particularly interesting in cases where two students responded to the same source video, as in a few of the examples featured here).</p>\n<p>Both the students and I were excited by the videos that resulted, and I went on to share them online, where they drew much interest and positive feedback, including from some of the makers of the source videos, who were honored to have their work responded to in such a way (needless to say, students were very excited to receive feedback from some of these makers!). Particularly during the long and stressful period of lockdown and isolation, I believe such a conversation was all the more welcome and appreciated, by both sides.</p>\n<p>This special issue hopes to continue this conversation; each student’s work is presented alongside the original work it responds to, and is accompanied by a creator’s statement by the student, and a written reflection by the maker of the original work. I hope this selection of videos and written reflections will serve to highlight the pedagogical value of this classroom assignment, and will perhaps inspire other teachers, students, and makers to employ it, further expanding on its dialogic potential.</p>\n"

      "body": "<p>As flattered as I was to learn that Ariel Avissar had used my video essay \"To the Lighthouse\" in his teaching, I was genuinely impressed by the response video made by his students Nitzan Kimel and Nadav Leshem, using a similar method of what we might call “inter-filmographic compilation”: taking clips from the filmographies of two actors and editing them to create a new filmic sequence that doubles as analysis. </p>\n<p>While “Friday Fight Fever” is a videographic response to “To the Lighthouse,” “To the Lighthouse” itself is a videographic response to the 2019 feature <em>The Lighthouse</em>. Through compiling and resequencing various expressions of affection and disgust by Dafoe and Pattinson, I intended “To the Lighthouse” to demonstrate how the actors’ filmographies anticipated the dysfunctional dynamics they perform in <em>The Lighthouse</em>. A key strategy was using dialogue from the assembled clips to create a synthetic verbal exchange between Pattinson and Dafoe. In comparison, “Saturday Fight Fever” concentrates its attention on the physical screen personas of actors John Travolta and Sylvester Stallone, irreverently appropriating their footage to stage a dance-off duel that’s equal parts hilarious and analytical. </p>\n<p>The opening section juxtaposes Travolta in a dance competition scene with Stallone moving frantically through an action movie shootout, suggesting a fascinating equivalence: that for Stallone, war is dance, while for Travolta, dance is war. By the middle section, another distinction becomes fully evident: there’s a consistency to Stallone’s invariably rigid body, while Travolta’s is more supple and variable - he even inhabits a woman’s body in <em>Hairspray</em>, an instance that amply demonstrates Travolta’s playfulness with his own persona. This might lead one to be more drawn to Travolta on the whole, but at times his look conveys a cocky supremacy over those around him. Meanwhile, numerous clips of Stallone taking countless blows in <em>Rocky</em> boxing matches convey a masochism bordering on onanism, a ring of abuse of his own making. While “Friday Night Fever” does a marvellous job creating an intricate pas de deux between these two actors, what emerges is the extent to which these two screen personas are isolated in their respective mythographies of masculinity.</p>\n"
